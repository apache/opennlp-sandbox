President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released its June fundraising numbers Monday, reporting that it raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney's approximately $100 million. The campaign responded with thanks to the more than 706,000 donors who got the campaign to that point but also appealed for more money.
"We still got beat -- and not by a little bit," Ann Marie Habershaw, chief operating officer for Obama for America, said in the e-mail. "If we lose this election, it will be because we didn't close the gap enough when we had the chance."
To be sure, neither campaign is raking in chump change. As we did with Romney's contributions, here's what the president could get for his $71 million.
2,071 students could attend the Sidwell Friends School for a year. Daughters Sasha and Malia attend the exclusive private school in Northwest D.C. (you could also afford hot lunches). At $34,268 annually, the school's tuition ranks higher than the average private university tuition in the United States and more than double what it costs to go to a public university.
32,272 Portuguese water dogs. At approximately $2,200 per pet, Bo, the first dog, could take on 32,272 purebred, hypoallergenic friends.
479,729 J. Crew Pembridge Dot pencil skirts. First lady Michelle Obama wore one at 10 Downing Street to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, and on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno. The double-worn mint green skirt runs $148 at the American clothing chain.
8 million pounds of arugula. While in Iowa in 2008, Obama was criticized for being out of touch after he asked a group of farmers whether they had checked out the price of arugula at Whole Foods. The boutique grocery store didn't open its first Iowa store until spring of this year, and several people present at his speech admitted they didn't know what arugula was. The current price is about $9 per pound.
3 Martha's Vineyard estates. The Obamas won't be going on vacation to Blue Heron Farm, otherwise referred to as the "Summer White House" off Cape Cod, and not just because of the demanding campaign schedule. The compound, which includes two full-sized homes, a par-3 golf hole and equestrian facilities, was listed in August for $23.7 million.
18,525 orders of Ben's Chili Bowl's chili half-smokes and cheese fries for the next year. At $10.50 per order, the Obama favorite could be a feast for a lot of your closest friends for the next 365 days.
65,558,632 Yuengling Lagers. At $6.49 per six-pack, the cost of one of Obama's favorite beers is approximately $1.08. Triple the cost at a bar, and you could still enjoy the company of 22 million other people -- 7% of the U.S. population -- sipping on the Pennsylvania brewery's finest
417,671 Spalding official NBA game balls. $71 million buys almost a half-million of the $169.99 basketballs. That means with 10 people to a court at a time, more than 4 million people could play one of Obama's -- and Americans' -- favorite sports simultaneously.
Take 7,099 couples on a Hawaiian vacation. The first couple could spring for the $10,000 to bring that many couples with them on a five-day holiday to the president's home state.
