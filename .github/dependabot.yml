        # The components' version should be aligned with primary components around 'opennlp-tools',
        # that is, the SNAPSHOT version should match the current in-development version.
        # Consequently, the opennlp-tools dependency can't be updated via dependabot and
        # is thus excluded / ignored here, as additional (manual) steps are required.
