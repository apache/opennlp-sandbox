 * A word sense disambiguator that determines which sense of a word is meant in

 * different senses of the ambiguous word. Disambiguation can be achieved in
 * either supervised or un-supervised approaches. A {@link Disambiguator} returns
 * a sense ID.
 * <p>
 * <b>How it works:</b><br/>
 * Just supply the context as an array of tokens and the
 * index of the target word to the disambiguate method.
 * <p>
 * Otherwise, for multiple words, you can set a word span instead of simply one
 * index. For the moment the source of sense definitions is from WordNet.
