Improbable 's Open Space Event DEVOTED AND DISGRUNTLED What are we going to do about theatre ? Facilitated by Phelim McDermott 7th and 8th January 2006 , 10am - 7pm At National Youth Theatre , 443-445 Holloway Road , London , N7 6LW I have been involved with professional theatre and performance since I left college in 1985 . Since that time I have created and co created shows which have ranged from totally improvised and devised work to classical texts for repertory theatres , from puppetry to site specific work and from dance theatre to comedy . I have performed , designed , written , devised , taught , improvised and served on the Board of the Actor 's centre . Yet in all this time I have often felt an outsider in my own profession . There are things I love about theatre and things I find very difficult . . t hings which I wish were different . I find myself both devoted and disgruntled . Over the years I have often found myself gossiping and moaning about how the world I work in could be better . Not just about what we put on the stage but how we produce , manage and administrate our work . How we create it in all aspects and how we treat each other as a creative community . As a result of a NESTA fellowship I have been able to train in and research some new ways of working with groups , learning from other creative and developmental fields . On 7th and 8th of January Improbable will be hosting an Open Space Event , which I will facilitate . It hopes to support some creative ideas and actions around the issues you might feel devoted and disgruntled about . It will address the things you care about and maybe wish could be different in any aspect of our profession . The things , which you feel are important or unaddressed in our community . It will be the first time Improbable has hosted an event like this and I invite you to join us in this new adventure of trying to make change happen , or even if you are just curious about a new way of working with groups in a self organising way . I would like to stress that this event will not just be a discussion or a talking shop . We are aiming to take action and to make a difference . If you care see you there . Phelim Phelim McDermott , Co-Artistic Director , Improbable Although Open Space may be new to you it has been used all over the world with predictable results . It will be an exciting open-ended event that enables a self-organising group to use its collective imagination to deal with complex issues and it will achieve this in an incredibly short space of time . By the end of the event the following will have occurred : - Every issue of concern to anybody will have been raised , if they took responsibility for doing that . - All issues will have received full discussion , to the extent desired . - A full report of issues and discussions will be in the hands of all participants . - And YOU will have taken part in making it happen . A strong point of Open Space is it 's ability to unite groups of enormous diversity , to that end we are encouraging all participants . HOW TO REGISTER : TICKETS : £ 15/person .
