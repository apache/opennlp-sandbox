Videos : See only video results using Google 's Video Search . Blogs : See only results from Google Blog Search . Places : See only results from Google Place Pages .

Customize your results by location The location used to customize your results is clearly indicated on the left side of your results page . Our location detection technology will automatically set a location for you , but you can easily specify an alternate location . Filter results by other criteria Based on your search and the Google property you 've selected , you 'll see a customized list of filtering tools . We 'll automatically show you the tools that seem most relevant to your search , so you wo n't always see all of these tools . Here are a few tools that you might see : Publish date Limit results according to when they were published on the Web . Google tries to estimate the publication date for a page by using information such as the date when Google first indexed the page . See the options Any time : By default , your search results will not be filtered by date . Latest : Sometimes the top results that show up are a little dated , although they 're still relevant . The Latest option shows you results that are both relevant and fresh . Google automatically optimizes the time period used for your filter to make sure that the most relevant and recent results are included . ( This option is only available when Everything is selected in the first group of options . ) Past 24 hours / Past week / Past month / Past year : Use these pre-defined ranges of times to find webpages . For instance , the Past 24 hours option will help you find information about current events . Custom range : This option lets you define your own date range . Enter the dates you want to use in the format mm/dd/yyyy , then click Search . This option works best for pages published after 2001 ; to find historical mentions of dates , try using the Timeline tool . Personalization Limit the results to content that is more personalized to you . For example , see content from your friends ( Social ) or content from a geographical area ( Nearby ) . See the options Social : If you 're signed in to Google , see only social search results . You 'll see publicly-accessible content from people in your social circle that is relevant to your search . The idea is that content from your friends and social contacts is often more relevant to you than content from strangers . Nearby : Only see results that might be especially relevant for your preferred location indicated on the side of your results page . You can easily specify your preferred location . Web History : Limit the results to pages you have or have not already visited . If you 're signed in to your Google Account and have Web History enabled , you can use this tool to restrict your results to pages you either have , or have n't , visited in the past while Web History was enabled . Want to find something new ? Try Not yet visited . Need to remember a helpful site from last month ? Visited pages will focus your search . Display options This section lets you change the way results are displayed . The default Standard view shows you regular Google results , where each result is composed of the page title and a few lines of text ( also known as the " snippet " ) . See the options Sites with images : See image thumbnails from the page alongside the snippet for each result . They can help you quickly identify whether the page is relevant to your search term . For example , if you see an image of a furry little critter when you search for [ mouse ] , you can probably deduce that the page is n't talking about computer equipment . Translated foreign pages : Sometimes , the best results for your search are written in another language . Based on your search term , Translated foreign pages automatically chooses the best language ( or languages ) to search in , translates your search , and then translates the results back to the language you prefer to read . Our automatic language selection is n't perfect , of course , so if you 'd like to search specific languages , select them in the panel above the results . Timeline : See results along a timeline , which is especially useful if you 're researching information about a historical person or event . Click any section in the timeline to zoom in on that time period . To change the time range , click Search other dates above the timeline to enter new start and end dates . Alternatively , click the date links below the timeline to see results that mention that particular year , month , or day . Reading level : You can limit your search results to a specific reading level ( Basic , Intermediate , or Advanced ) . Learn more about the Reading level tool . Content type options When you select a specific type of content like Videos or Realtime , you 'll often see a set of tools that are unique to that selection . For example , if you select Images , you can filter image results by size , type , and color . Learn more about the search tools specific to Google Images . See definitions for your search term using Dictionary . You can also find synonyms , images , usage examples , and learn if the term is a word in other languages . Discover more results If you 're ever unsure about the precise terms you should use for your search , start out with a broader search term , then use these tools to discover alternative search terms . The Something different option lets you find parallel searches that you might find interesting . See the options Related searches : See related searches at the top of the results page . They 'll stay there , even as you scroll up and down , so you can easily compare and contrast results for different related searches . Wonder wheel : This option visually presents connections between related searches and your search term as an interactive diagram . Click the different nodes in the diagram to see how searches can branch out . Something different : The bottom set of links on the side of the search results page includes alternative queries to help you discover webpages that are indirectly related to your search .
