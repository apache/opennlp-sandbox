I just went down to Ministry of Sound ( World 's Biggest Club , and all that ) to support Paul ' Bigtime ' Stanway , my best friend , on his DJ debut . I do n't like Ministry . It 's too big and soul-less . But he was DJing , he 's my friend , and I wanted to give support . I intended to stay for an hour and then catch the last tube home . Then Grandmaster Flash came on . Now , everybody knows the guy 's a legend . I have a lot of his stuff from the early 80 's . But I never knew quite how good he is . Understatement : Flash is AMAZING . It was a proper Old School party . He mixed everything from OPP to Queen . And his scratching ... Wow . It was like a real ' back in the day ' affair . I just got home . And I 'll be knackered for work tomorrow . But ... I 'm almost speechless . It was awesome . Best night I 've had at Ministry . Bar none . And it was all captured on DAT ... ca n't wait to get a copy of it . I love it when a low-key night turns into a great one . And Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-1 . Good , great , fantastic night .
