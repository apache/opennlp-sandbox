Reduce Cancer Reoccurrence , Wheatgerm Extract , Cancer : The Wheatgerm Extract That May Help Reduce Cancer Reoccurrence Cancer treatment has come a long way since the use of mustard gas derivatives in the early 1900s - or has it ? When doctors discovered during World War I that mustard gas destroyed bone marrow , they began to experiment with it as a way to kill cancer cells . Although they had little success with the mustard gas , it did pave the way for modern chemotherapy - which involves the most toxic and poisonous substances anyone deliberately puts in his body . These treatments kill much more than cancer cells - they have a devastating effect even on healthy ones . Sometimes it seems as if only a miracle could provide a cure that 's both safe and effective . And a miracle is just what Dr . Mate Hidvegi believed he found when he patented Avemar . Studies have shown that Avemar , a fermented wheatgerm extract , helps reduce cancer reoccurrence , possibly speed up cancer cell death and helps the immune system identify cancer cells for attack . A miracle in the making Back in World War I , Dr . Albert Szent-Györgyi ( a Nobel Prize recipient in 1937 for his discovery of vitamin C ) had seen the effects of mustard gas personally and was determined to find a safer alternative for cancer treatment . His goal was to prevent the rapid reproduction that is characteristic of cancer cells . He theorised that supplemental quantities of naturally occurring compounds in wheatgerm called DMBQ would help to chaperone cellular metabolism , allowing healthy cells to follow a normal course but prohibiting potentially cancerous ones from growing and spreading . His early experiments , published in the 1960s , confirmed his theory . But then the science community shifted its focus to killing cancer outright . It was n't until the fall of communism in Hungary in 1989 - when scientists were allowed for the first time to pursue independent , personal interests - that Dr . Hidvegi picked up where Szent-Györgyi left off . He was able to patent a technique of fermenting wheat germ with baker 's yeast . He named this fermented product Avemar and it became the standard compound for research and later commercialisation because it assured a longer shelf life while maintaining its live food status . Reduce cancer reoccurrence Since 1996 , over 100 studies done on Avemar have impressed oncologists and cancer researchers . Studies have shown that when Avemar is used as an adjunct treatment , it enhances the effects of the standard treatment agents . It 's particularly effective in reducing the chances of cancer reoccurrence . In a controlled study , 170 subjects with primary colorectal cancer either had surgery and standard care with chemotherapy or the same plus 9g of Avemar taken once a day . Only 3 per cent of the people in the Avemar group experienced a reoccurrence , vs . more than 17 per cent of those in the chemo-only group . The Avemar group also showed a 67 per cent reduction in metastasis and a 62 per cent reduction in deaths.1 In a randomized study , 46 stage III melanoma patients with a high risk of reoccurrence either had surgery and standard care with chemotherapy or surgery plus standard care and 9g of Avemar taken once a day . Those taking Avemar showed approximately a 50 per cent reduction in risk of progression.2 Avemar also reduced the frequency and severity of many common side-effects , including nausea , fatigue , weight loss and immune suppression . Avemar speeds cancer cell death The second way Avemar works against cancer is to help keep cancer cells from repairing themselves . Cancer cells reproduce quickly and chaotically , producing many breaks and other mistakes in the cellular structure . Because of this , cancer cells need a lot of the enzyme known as PARP ( poly-ADP-ribose ) to help repair breaks in DNA before the cells divide . For daily reports on the very latest health breakthroughs , join our FREE daily email service : It is thought that without adequate PARP , cancer cells cannot complete DNA replication . When there 's no PARP to repair the damage , an enzyme called Caspase-3 initiates programmed cell death . Avemar has been shown to potentially speed up the death of cancer cells by helping inhibit the production of PARP and enhancing the production of Caspase-3.3 US researchers at UCLA also showed that Avemar may reduce the production of RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) and DNA associated with the rapid reproduction of cancer cells . It also helps restore normal pathways of cell metabolism and may increase the production of RNA and DNA associated with healthy cells.4 Undercover cancer cells exposed Avemar may also act as a biological bounty hunter for hidden cancer cells . Healthy cells have a surface molecule called MHC-1 that tells natural killer ( NK ) cells not to attack . Virally infected cells do n't display this molecule , which makes them targets . However , cancer cells have also been shown to display the surface molecule MHC-1 , which means that cancer cells may actually be able to hide from NK cells . Avemar is thought to help the immune system identify cancer cells for attack by suppressing their ability to generate this MHC-1 mask , which allows the NK cells to recognize it as a target for attack.5 What to take for best results The Avemar product is an instant drink mix called Avé , which combines Avemar with natural orange flavouring and fructose in pre-measured packets . As a dietary supplement , the recommended usage is one packet per day mixed with 8oz of cold water . You should consume it within 30 minutes of mixing a batch . Also note that it 's a good idea to take Avé one hour before or after a meal and two hours before or after any drugs or other dietary supplements . If you weigh over 200 pounds ( 14 stone ) , use two packets per day . If you weigh less than 100 pounds ( 7 stone ) , only use half of a packet per day . Although some people reported uneasiness in their stomachs during the first few days of using Avemar , the effect only lasted a few days . No vomiting , diarrhoea , or any other symptoms were reported . Contraindications : Since this is a wheat product , there is the potential for allergic response . Avemar should not be consumed by people who have had an organ or tissue transplant , those who have malabsorption syndrome , or those with allergies to foods containing gluten , such as wheat , rye , oats and barley . It 's also not recommended for people with fructose intolerance or hypersensitivity to gluten , wheatgerm , or any of the components or ingredients of this product . If you suffer from bleeding ulcers , you should stop using Avemar two days before undergoing a barium X-ray contrast examination and resume taking it two days after the completion of the examination . This precaution is necessary because wheatgerm contains lectin , which can potentially cause red blood cells to clump . If you are currently taking medications or have any adverse health conditions , you should consult with your pharmacist or physician before taking Avemar . Sources : 1.
