Participants : Ronnie Irving , Ian Kinley , Derek McAlone and Dave Thexton General Comments This was essentially a repeat of a trip that three of us ( RI , IK and DT ) had made in October 2002 though an additional five days allowed us more time at each site and an opportunity to explore a new area ( the plains of southern Badajoz ) . Although the dates of the two trips overlapped , we noticed a number of differences ; in particular , in 2003 we saw plenty of Purple Herons and Hoopoes ( we had none in 2002 ) while Los Lances ( Tarifa Beach ) was drier and less productive in 2003 than in 2002 . There were many highlights in two bird-filled weeks but perhaps the abiding memory will be of a spectacular concentration of thousands of Glossy Ibis , storks , egrets , waders and gulls packed into one wet rice field at Isla Menor . It was also interesting to note the change in birds during the course of our trip - in the space of two weeks Meadow Pipits and Serins had gone from non-existent to common while swifts had disappeared . As last year we failed to find any rare swifts at Bolonia or Zahara , nor could we find any Little Bustards despite plenty of easily visible Great Bustards on the plains of southern Badajoz . We also repeated what is fast becoming a traditional fruitless search for Azure-winged Magpies in the horrendous Algaida Pinewoods ( they were , of course , all over the place north of Seville ) . Weather Quite mixed with some cool days and a fair amount of rain . Low cloud , rain and unfavourable winds at times hampered raptor migration at Tarifa , which proved less spectacular than in 2002 . About half the time however , conditions were ideal ; dry , sunny , calm and warm but never too hot to bird . Birding light lasted from about 08.15 ( no need for early starts ! ) to about 20.15 . Travel We flew from Liverpool to Malaga with EasyJet ( Â£ 100 return , booked over the internet , very efficient and virtually hassle-free ) . At Malaga airport , we picked up a hired Renault Scenic Diesel from Record Rentacar ( 342 euros , booked over the internet with Carjet and again very smooth and efficient ) . Accommodation We had not intended to pre-book any accommodation , having had no problems in 2002 , but prior to departure we learned that the European Kite Surfing Championships were being held in Tarifa during our time there so decided to book somewhere for the first few nights . We need not have worried ; it turned out to be no busier than usual , there is ample choice of accommodation in the area and we would have had no difficulty finding somewhere . However , we did have problems later in the trip - we had to move earlier than planned from our hotel in Fuente de Cantos as it was fully booked the next night ( a Saturday , frequently difficult for accommodation in our experience ) and , more seriously , we could not find any accommodation at all in , or near , Grazalema . Half a dozen hotels were all full and a radical change of itinerary saw us abandon our stay in the mountains and return to Tarifa . Anyone planning to visit the Grazalema area would be well advised to book in advance , at least at weekends , and be prepared for hordes of noisy tourists . We stayed at the following : - Hotel Cortija Las Pinas ( set back from the N340 8km west of Tarifa ) www . c ortijolaspinas . c om Four nights , 37 euros per night per twin-bedded apartment . Very comfortable ( though the lack of air-conditioning may be a problem in hotter periods ) and well situated . No proper restaurant but there was plenty nearby . Hostal Alcazar ( just east of Chipiona alongside road to Sanlucar de Barrameda ) Two nights ; 30 euros a night per twin-bedded room . Comfortable ( with air-conditioning ) and good value . Much better than outward appearances suggested . No restaurant but bar open in evenings and owner did get up specially to make us coffee at 07.30 . Hotel El Desembarco at Los Palacios y Villafranca Avenida de Cadiz , 4. 41.720 Los Palacios . Sevilla . T el:95 581 31 00 Fax:95 581 23 23 . Two nights ; 35 euros per night per twin-bedded room . Very comfortable and excellent value . Good restaurant and bar . Sole drawback was difficulty with on-street parking ( we managed to pick up a parking ticket ! ) . Hotel Rural " La Fabrica " at Fuente de Cantos http://www.hrlafabrica.com or e-mail hotel@hrlafabrica . c om Two nights ; 55 euros per night per twin-bedded room . Very nice indeed if a touch pricey ( though not by British standards ) . Good restaurant . Excellent location with Great Bustards , Black Vultures and Black-bellied Sandgrouse just five minutes drive away and Black-shouldered Kites within 15km . Hostal El Pilar at Monesterio One night ; 36 euros a night per twin-bedded room . Comfortable and good value but a lot of traffic noise . Very good bar/restaurant just across the road under same ownership . The restaurant menu included some interesting English translations such as " scum " which turned out to be ice cream and " thorns to the brave sauce " which remained unidentified , as none of us was brave enough to order it ! Hotel Cordoniz ( alongside N340 just west of Tarifa ) La Codorniz , Carretera Nacional 340 - Km . 79 , 11380 TARIFA ( Cadiz ) http://www.lacodorniz.com Tel ( 34 ) 956 684744 Fax : ( 34 ) 956 684101 Two nights ; 70 euros per night per twin-bedded bungalow apartment including , unusually , continental breakfast ( served from 08.00 , allowing just enough time before it got light enough to bird ) . Superb , very comfortable , excellent restaurant and brilliant location . Easily the best place we stayed but reflected in the price . Itinerary October 1st : Malaga-Tarifa , with most of our half-day 's birding at or near Tarifa . October 2nd-4th : Based at Tarifa with birding done in Tarifa area , La Janda and Sierra de la Plata .

October 7th-8th : Based at Los Palacios y Villafranca birding sites on the east bank of the Guadalquivir ( Brazo del Este/Isla Menor ) . October 9th : Los Palacios y Villafranca-Fuente de Cantos birding en route and , in evening , in the Fuente de Cantos area . October 10th-11th : Fuente de Cantos area including Sierra de Hornachos . Overnight at Monesterio on 11th . October 12th : Monesterio-Isla Menor . Full morning 's birding at Isla Menor before travelling to Grazalema . Failed to find accommodation and continued on to Tarifa . October 13th-14th : Birding in Tarifa area before travelling to Malaga late morning on 14th . Sites Visited : Los Lances ( Tarifa Beach ) Superb site that we accessed from several points between the harbour and the football stadium c2km to the north . Rather drier ( especially on our second visit ) than in 2002 with gulls and terns less obliging but different birds every day and well worth repeated visits . We found seawatching better from the beach near the football stadium and/or the causeway to the island than from the coast on the Mediterranean side of the fort , with birds closer and more numerous ( though you do lose the advantage of height ) . The dunes and rough grassy areas behind the beach were also well worth exploring . Lots of potential for a major " find " here . We also paid several visits to the inlet behind Playa Palomas , which is essentially an extension of Los Lances about 8km north of Tarifa . Though heavily disturbed by surfers , it did have an interesting tidal inlet with potential for good birds . Ciguena Negra watchpoint , Tarifa We did our raptor watching from here ( which we called Tarifa Observatory in our 2002 report ) . It 's the first viewpoint east of Tarifa ( take the first minor track left off the main road near the top of the hill going east out of Tarifa in the direction of an ugly-looking Cepsa compound/building ) . The small concrete observatory structure ( now sporting a nice drawing or two Black Storks on the wall ) is situated on a low foothill overlooking the town and coastal strip and affords some protection from the sun and wind . It is manned at times by locals monitoring the raptor and stork migration La Janda ( pictured right ) Excellent plains area , with reedy drainage ditches and rice fields , plenty of potential . Very drivable tracks , with no apparent access problems , at an elevated level to the surrounding fields . Huge numbers of White Storks assembling close to the tracks with raptors constantly in view overhead . Sierra de la Plata Area of low coastal limestone hills , not brilliant overall though well known for breeding White-rumped and Little Swifts . Bonanza Salinas Superb site with no access problems ( contrary to Gosney ) . Large concentrations of birds with a network of drivable tracks allowing very close views . Algaida Salinas Another excellent area . Again there are now no access problems ( see Gosney ) . An extension of the above site with similar birds though the generally deeper water resulted in a subtle difference in the species using the area . Trebujena Marismas An interesting area of farmland , marismas and lagoons situated between Trebujena and the Guadalquivir north of Algaida . We saw our only Pin-tailed Sandgrouse here . Laguna de Tarelo Good access and viewing , with easy White-headed Ducks . Algaida Pinewoods We again failed to see the promised Azure-winged Magpies here in two visits . Not an enjoyable area to bird due to local " boy racers " on motorbikes and inconsiderate 4xwheel drive owners haring along the rough track . May be more productive when quiet . Brazo del Este/Isla Menor Superb site that includes the area Gosney refers to as the Pinzon Marshes . Close range viewing mostly from a road level higher than the surrounding habitat gives wonderful views of the full range of marisma species . A must visit site , which , with reports of accessible areas of the Coto Donana being dry at the time of our trip , appears to have more reliable water levels than the Coto itself . In fact , water levels at Brazo del Este were considerable higher than in 2002 with no muddy margins for the Bluethroats or waders seen last year . However , more than adequate compensation was provided by the rice fields at Isla Menor where harvesting was underway and conditions were perfect for feeding waterbirds . Water levels are likely to change constantly - indeed they had done so between our two visits - and it 's a case of driving the network of tracks to find where the birds are concentrated . Make sure you continue beyond the Acebuche Bar onto the tracks towards San Vicente Ferrier - we found this the most productive area on our visit . Plains of southern Badajoz We birded the triangle formed by Fuente de Cantos , Llerena and Usagre but concentrated most on the area east of Fuente de Cantos where we were based and found it excellent for Great Bustards and Black-bellied Sandgrouse though we saw neither Little Bustards nor Pin-tailed Sandgrouse here . It was also pretty good for raptors with Black-shouldered Kite , Bonelli 's Eagle , Golden Eagle , Black Vulture , Hen Harrier and lots of Red Kites . Sierra de Hornachos Disappointing with far fewer raptors on show than the literature had led us to believe . For details and directions to all the sites we visited we used : - Gosney 's Finding Birds in Southern Spain . Though in most cases the directions and maps were up to the usual high standard , woefully out of date in places , especially re Bonanza and Algaida Salinas . Also in the section on Brazo del Este he regularly refers to Isla Major when he means Isla Menor . No updates were available on the Birdguides website prior to our trip . Where to watch birds in Southern and Western Spain by Garcia and Patterson . Excellent and up to date , with much useful background information . Birdwatching on Spain 's Southern Coast by John R. Butler . See also his website at www . d onanabirdtours . c om which gives some site information and includes up-to-date trip reports from the Donana area . Useful extra information was gleaned from trip reports available on the Birdtours website www . b irdtours . c o. u k/tripreports and we also looked at the Rare Birds in Spain website www . r arebirdspain . n et prior to our trip for info on latest rarities . We used the Michelin map 446 Espagne Sud Species List We recorded a total of 180 species , listed below . The figures in brackets represent the number of days each species was recorded e. g . ( 4/14 ) means that a species was seen on four days during our 14 day trip ( bearing in mind that the first and last days were really only half-days of birding ) and gives a crude indication of how easy each species was to see . More details are given of the rarer or more interesting species .
