After studying the Wordtracker results for the MSN and Google search engines for words that include " massage , " we picked the third result , " Techniques of Massage , " because it 's an excellent and appropriate angle for our client . The #1 result in MSN has a KEI of 3696 , but it would n't work with our client 's site . You have to be sure to choose keyword phrases that are appropriate for your particular client 's site . At MSN , " Techniques of Massage " has a KEI of 255 . Within a 24- hour period , if your site was placed well in the MSN engine , you could expect to get 90 visitors from MSN alone . What is your competition ? 1954 . " Techniques of Massage " in Google has a KEI of 900 , 165 potential visitors through Google alone in a 24-hour period , and competition of only 555 . Remember that a " good " KEI is anything over 100 , and an " excellent " KEI is anything over 400 . Let 's be honest here . You could manage a top 10 for this keyword phrase with your eyes closed ( and your computer turned off ) . So , for our aromatherapy client , we could create a page on the various techniques of massage , including ( of course ) her oils and aromatherapy products . We would spend time on the page and give it true value to both the engines and the target audience . And , we would subtly add graphics and link text that points to the client 's products in various areas of the page . John gave another example He says , " If you 're selling ' digital cameras , ' do n't optimize for ' digital cameras . ' Did you know that everyone is searching for ' Digital Cameras Review ' ? Build a page offering reviews of digital cameras , which has a KEI that just blew me away . " Another effective strategy : Top Reports Besides Comprehensive Search , John also likes to look at the top reports for high performance keywords or topics that are related to his client . John explains , " I 'll review the Long Term Reports , which are the top 1000 keywords over the past 24 hours . Then , I cut and paste any topics related to my client into Comprehensive Search to get streams of currently ' hot topics . ' I define a hot topic as a popular topic in high demand , which may also have lists of related keywords phrases also in high demand . " What happens if you ca n't find a hot topic that relates to your site in the top 1000 ? John answers , " Many people do not know that Wordtracker offers extensive top word reports beyond the database . All you have to do is ask , and they 'll sell you : * The Top 20,000 words $ 99 * The Top 100,000 words $ 500 * The Top 500,000 words $ 2000 " Additional suggestions * When John goes to Comprehensive Search , he does n't put in a huge list of keyword phrases . He types in one single word , then lets Comprehensive Search do the rest . This allows him to come up with ideas and angles that he would have never considered before . * Like John , spend a lot of time thinking of your target audience . Who are you trying to sell the products or services to ? There may be several target audiences , as in the case of our aromatherapy example . If so , go after keyword choices to target each of those audiences . * Do n't be afraid to let your creativity take hold . If your first few choices do n't work , continue trying . Using Comprehensive Search , it does n't take long to go back through the system with a different keyword idea . Keep going back until you find a possibility that might work for your site or the site of a client . * Be sure to give the surfer what they 're looking for when they choose your site from the search results . If you promised them " techniques of massage , " then be sure to give them good , solid content in that area , including related links . Weave your products and services throughout the page as you can . But , do n't ever try to trick a surfer . * If you get stuck and just ca n't find a keyword phrase with a high KEI and a low level of competition that will work for you , take a slightly different approach . Instead of trying to bring in a large amount of traffic through one single window , try creating several windows and bring in a little traffic through each one . Though more time consuming , this strategy can be equally effective in the long run . * If you are n't already a member of Wordtracker ( http://www.wordtracker.com ) , sign up for the free trial and test the system out for yourself . Pricing is very reasonable , depending on your needs . For example , you can use the service for a week for $ 19.94 , and many other plans are available . The bottom line is this : if you are serious about your Web site , you 've got to be serious about keyword choice . If you 're serious about keyword choice , Wordtracker is a " must have " service for you .
