For the first time , diaries sent to all National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers ( NASUWT ) members this week will outline how teachers can best tackle the problem . It is unacceptable that teachers should face violence at work Eamonn O'Kane , NASUWT The guidelines urge teachers to report all incidents of actual or threatened assault or criminal damage to the police . The advice also recommends staff be given training in avoiding and managing dangerous situations . The NASUWT calls on head teachers to introduce a code of " zero tolerance " towards pupils who have been excluded And parents who have been abusive or violent towards staff should be banned from school premises . A failure by schools to put in place adequate protection for teachers may lead to risk assessments for violent and disruptive pupils and a refusal to teach those who pose a real danger , the union warns . Violent pupils NASUWT general secretary Eamonn O'Kane said : " It is unacceptable that teachers should face violence at work . " " NASUWT guidance highlights options available to limit the threat . By including this in the diary , every member can carry round details of the steps necessary to protect themselves in school . " Although the numbers of pupils excluded last year went up for the first time in the past six years , NASUWT remains concerned that governing bodies continue to readmit violent and disruptive pupils . " Last month the Department for Education issued posters to all schools in England warning parents they faced prosecution if they threatened or abused staff . The posters , similar to those found in hospitals and on public transport , were accompanied by a " toolkit " setting out the legal position on parental violence .
