Public opinion Mr Niyazov already has several schools , cities , airports and even a meteorite named after him . Niyazov has ruled Turkmenistan unchallenged since 1985 Many people on the streets of Turkmenistan seemed unperturbed , but others were bitter regarding their leader 's latest plans . " This is a joke , the entire civilized world lives by the same calendar but Niyazov decides to set us apart once again , " one man told the AFP news agency . " It seems like he lives on another planet . " Cult of personality The People 's Council also called on Thursday for the eccentric leader to remain in power until his death , rejecting Mr Niyazov 's proposal to step down and hold elections in 2010 , Reuters news agency reported . He was made president for life in 1999 . Mr Niyazov has ruled the country since he was appointed Communist Party chief in 1985 when it was still part of the Soviet Union . He quickly developed a cult of personality surrounding himself , suppressing legitimate political opposition . He has spent vast sums of money on lavish palaces and statues of himself , despite the country 's increasing poverty . Much of the cash for such grandiose projects is thought to stem from deals involving Turkmenistan 's rich oil and gas reserves .
