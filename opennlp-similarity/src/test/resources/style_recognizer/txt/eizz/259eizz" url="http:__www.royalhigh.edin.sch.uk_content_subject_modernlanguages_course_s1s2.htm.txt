Modern Languages S1/S2 Course All pupils at the Royal High School follow a common course in either French or German in S1 and S2 . It is expected that all pupils continue with the foreign language they started in the primary school . The Modern Languages dept has regular contact with each of our associated primaries and we endeavour to acknowledge prior learning at all times .

Use is made of listening posts , TV and video , internet and the department benefits from having a foreign language assistant from both France and Germany each year . Teaching takes place in whole class groups , which are , where possible , set according to ability and aptitude . The foreign languages assistants can work with smaller groups and can also work within the classroom alongside the class teacher . Pupils are assessed regularly and their progress is recorded as a progression within the 5-14 national guidelines . Pupils can anticipate an assessment at the end of each unit or topic which will allow both themselves and their teacher to measure the progress they have made . Tests are made in all skill areas - reading , listening , speaking and writing .
