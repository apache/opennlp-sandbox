TENTSMUIR - FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY 23rd June 2006 The Tentsmuir NNR celebration is suitable for all but families are especially welcome . Booking is essential as places go fast , but places are free ( no dogs please ) . The activities , which are also all free , include : · Mini-beast hunts for children over 8 · Curly caterpillar needs your help activity for under 5s · Nature One for the under 7s · Nature sculptures on the beach · Sketch and paint for adults and the older child · Viewpoint binoculars and telescopes - SNH staff on hand to answer questions · Guided walk - find out why the reserve is so special , from butterflies to seals · Storyteller - Amu Logtse and his amazing drums The reserve is a large area of grassy sand dunes and the huge Abertay Sands sand bar which stretches eastward from the landward tip of Tentsmuir . Sediment from the sand bar dries and blows westwards on the wind adding to the land . This is then stabilised by plants such as sea rocket , lyme grass and marram grass and becomes new land . There are free refreshments , including a free picnic lunch , and a free coach from the Forest Enterprise operated car park through the forest to the reserve . The Forest Enterprise car park costs one pound for parking . To book places for the day phone 01382 553704 and leave a name , address and telephone number and the number of places to be booked . Places are only secured if the reserve manager phones callers and confirms the booking . Tom Cunningham , SNH 's Tentsmuir reserve manager , said : ' A visit to Tentsmuir is a chance to find out about the history , flowers , birds and animals here and to have a really good day out . I hope that people will book early for the day as it will be lots of fun with plenty to do and well worth coming to . ' The reserve is home to large groups of wildfowl and waders such as pink footed geese , bar tailed godwits , grey plovers and the largest gathering of eider ducks in Britain . It is also used by thousands of grey and common seals . Plants on the dune grassland include yellow bird 's foot trefoil , pink ragged robin , violets , purple northern marsh orchid and white grass of Parnassus . Among the plants are hundreds of butterflies and moths such as day flying burnet moths .
