Web2.0 at d. c onstruct By Ben I 've just come off stage here at the d. c onstruct Web2.0 conference in Brighton . I was talking about backstage . b bc . c o. u k and it 's involvement in the Web2.0 community . I also gave the first public demo of the BBC Programme Catalogue project , which Matt Biddulph and Ben Hammersley are currently working on ( that project is hopefully due to be launched in beta in the new year ) . There 's a great crowd of people here at d. c onstruct â ' perhaps 80 or so . We 've been listening to speakers ranging from AJAX experts through to the representatives of other sites with a Web2.0 presence ( such as Simon Willison from Flickr ) . My presentation from the event is available here . 11 Nov 2005 02:56 PM Comments Post a comment 1. On 15 Nov 2005 03:11 PM , Nazim Beltran said : Great presentation .
