Gentleman Jim , the greatest Blue of all He was one of the great names in football during the game 's golden age after World War Two when crowds flocked back to soccer in their millions . Born in Alton 1925 , Dickinson joined Pompey from Alton Youth Club . After three years in the Royal Navy , he made his league debut against Blackburn Rovers at Fratton Park in 1946 . He established the number six shirt as his own and helped steer Pompey to successive league championships . And a total of 48 appearances for England made him Pompey 's most capped player of all time . He played 764 league games for Pompey - a record for one player at a single club which was not broken until Swindon 's John Trollope went six better in 1980 . Dickinson was a gentleman both on and off the pitch . He was never booked or sent off in 800 Pompey and England matches . Dickinson was a Pompey stalwart for almost 20 years . Awarded the MBE in 1964 , he played his last match for the Blues a year later , helping Pompey to a 1-1 end-of-season draw at Northampton that secured safety from relegation .
