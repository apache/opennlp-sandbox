The National Biodiversity Network ( NBN ) is home to all information on the nation 's biodiversity . You can find the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) for your area from www . b iodiversityscotland . o rg or www . s earchnbn . n et The involvement of the people of Scotland is essential if we are to conserve biodiversity for today and the future . Across Scotland , people are taking action for biodiversity in their own ' back yard ' . Local Biodiversity Action Plan partnerships have been set up , involving government agencies , national and local voluntary bodies and community groups all working together . Local wildlife sites are being managed , greenspace networks established and gardens made more wildlife friendly . Public bodies are looking to include action for biodiversity in their everyday activities . Wherever you live in Scotland , there are opportunities to get involved in biodiversity conservation locally . Twenty-four Local Biodiversity Action Plans ( LBAPs ) cover the country from Shetland in the north to Galloway in the south and from the Western Isles/Na h-Eileanan Siar in the west to Aberdeen in the east . Each LBAP is overseen by a partnership of national and local organisations , some of which also contribute funding to the project . In most cases core funding is provided by SNH and the Local Authority , with a variety of other organisations contributing in different circumstances . One or more LBAP Officers may be employed ( usually by one of the partner organisations - most often the Local Authority ) to promote and co-ordinate activities . In some areas , the additional post is a Community Biodiversity Officer , with a specific remit to encourage community involvement in the LBAP . The work of LBAPs contributes in many ways to fulfilling the objectives of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy , particularly in terms : of halting the loss of biodversity and bringing about the recovery of threatened habitats and species ; increasing people 's awareness , enjoyment and understanding of biodiversity and getting more people involved in its conservation ; integrating and co-ordinating consideration of biodiversity into all decision making ; and ensuring that the most up-to-date knowledge of biodiversity is available to decision-makers . Local Authorities have a duty to achieve " best value " in delivering the services which they provide , Guidance on " Best Value and Biodiversity in Scotland " is available via the Scottish Executive website . In addition , all public bodies have a duty under the Nature Conservation ( Scotland ) Act to further the conservation of biodiversity in carrying out their functions . An important function of LBAPs is to raise people 's awareness of their local biodiversity and what they can do to help . This applies to all sectors of society , and LBAPs may work with schools , youth groups , ethnic minorities , special-interest groups , businesses - in fact , anybody at all ! This type of work can include arts projects , story telling , production of leaflets , websites or CDs , and a whole range of activities several steps removed from hands-on habitat or species management . Greenspace Scotland Eco-schools Biodiversity Stories Business & biodiversity project So what do LBAPs actually do ? Most have by now completed the initial stage of drafting their own Local Biodiversity Action Plan . The Plan includes an assessment of which species and habitats are of particular importance in the local area . These will include species or habitats on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority list which occur locally , and also species and habitats considered important by local people . The Plan then sets out what needs to be done , and by whom , to improve the status of the chosen species and habitats . Some LBAPs may take on the function of identifying local sites of importance for biodiversity , which can then be taken into account by the authorities in decision-making . Information on species distribution can be obtained from the National Biodiversity Network Gateway however , this is not comprehensive . The umbrella organisation BRISC ( Biological Recording in Scotland ) is working to improve the availability of data on the distribution of Scottish habitats and species through projects such as " Wildlife Counts " . In some areas Local Biodiversity Records Centres hold this information at a local level . Links to these Centres can be obtained from the BRISC website . After deciding what needs to be done to improve the status of local biodiversity , resources must be found to do it . This may mean money , manpower or specialist expertise . Funding for project implementation can be sought from SNH under our " Supporting Biodiversity " or " Involving People " grant schemes , from locally-applicable European funds ( e. g . Leader + ) , Landfill Tax Credit Schemes , Lottery funds , charitable trusts and a variety of other sources , including of course the LBAP partner organisations . Lottery funding is also currently available through the BBC Breathing Places campaign .
