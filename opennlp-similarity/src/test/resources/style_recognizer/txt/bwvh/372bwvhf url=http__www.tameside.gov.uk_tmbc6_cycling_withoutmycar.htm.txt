In Town Without My Car Every year between 16th and 22nd September , " In Town Without My Car " is promoted as part of European Mobility Week . In 2005 , fifty two ( 52 ) towns in the United Kingdom took part in this activity . European Mobility Week has become established in both the UK and abroad and traditionally culminates with In Town Without My Car ! Day on 22nd September . This involves the closure of streets ( car parks ) to cars and lorries in participating towns , allowing people to enjoy walking , cycling , street theatre , live music , public art and children 's play areas . It creates a less polluted , quieter urban area for a day . It helps us rediscover our towns and encourages us to think about the ways in which we travel in them .
