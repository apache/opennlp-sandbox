﻿ Manifesto of the Communist Party A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism . All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre : Pope and Tsar , Metternich and Guizot , French Radicals and German police-spies . Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power ? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism , against the more advanced opposition parties , as well as against its reactionary adversaries ? Two things result from this fact : I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power . II . It is high time that Communists should openly , in the face of the whole world , publish their views , their aims , their tendencies , and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself . To this end , Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto , to be published in the English , French , German , Italian , Flemish and Danish languages . I. Bourgeois and Proletarians* The history of all hitherto existing society † is the history of class struggles . Freeman and slave , patrician and plebeian , lord and serf , guild-master ‡ and journeyman , in a word , oppressor and oppressed , stood in constant opposition to one another , carried on an uninterrupted , now hidden , now open fight , a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes . In the earlier epochs of history , we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders , a manifold gradation of social rank . In ancient Rome we have patricians , knights , plebeians , slaves ; in the Middle Ages , feudal lords , vassals , guild-masters , journeymen , apprentices , serfs ; in almost all of these classes , again , subordinate gradations . The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms . It has but established new classes , new conditions of oppression , new forms of struggle in place of the old ones . Our epoch , the epoch of the bourgeoisie , possesses , however , this distinct feature : it has simplified class antagonisms . Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps , into two great classes directly facing each other – Bourgeoisie and Proletariat . From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns . From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed . The discovery of America , the rounding of the Cape , opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie . The East-Indian and Chinese markets , the colonisation of America , trade with the colonies , the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally , gave to commerce , to navigation , to industry , an impulse never before known , and thereby , to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society , a rapid development . The feudal system of industry , in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds , now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets . The manufacturing system took its place . The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class ; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop . Meantime the markets kept ever growing , the demand ever rising . Even manufacturer no longer sufficed . Thereupon , steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production . The place of manufacture was taken by the giant , Modern Industry ; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires , the leaders of the whole industrial armies , the modern bourgeois . Modern industry has established the world market , for which the discovery of America paved the way . This market has given an immense development to commerce , to navigation , to communication by land . This development has , in its turn , reacted on the extension of industry ; and in proportion as industry , commerce , navigation , railways extended , in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed , increased its capital , and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages . We see , therefore , how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development , of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange . Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class . An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility , an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune* : here independent urban republic ( as in Italy and Germany ) ; there taxable “ third estate ” of the monarchy ( as in France ) ; afterwards , in the period of manufacturing proper , serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility , and , in fact , cornerstone of the great monarchies in general , the bourgeoisie has at last , since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market , conquered for itself , in the modern representative State , exclusive political sway . The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie . The bourgeoisie , historically , has played a most revolutionary part . The bourgeoisie , wherever it has got the upper hand , has put an end to all feudal , patriarchal , idyllic relations . It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “ natural superiors ” , and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest , than callous “ cash payment ” . It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour , of chivalrous enthusiasm , of philistine sentimentalism , in the icy water of egotistical calculation . It has resolved personal worth into exchange value , and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms , has set up that single , unconscionable freedom – Free Trade . In one word , for exploitation , veiled by religious and political illusions , it has substituted naked , shameless , direct , brutal exploitation . The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe . It has converted the physician , the lawyer , the priest , the poet , the man of science , into its paid wage labourers . The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil , and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation . The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages , which reactionaries so much admire , found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence . It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about . It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids , Roman aqueducts , and Gothic cathedrals ; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades . The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production , and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society . Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form , was , on the contrary , the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes . Constant revolutionising of production , uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions , everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones . All fixed , fast-frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away , all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify . All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned , and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life , and his relations with his kind . The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe . It must nestle everywhere , settle everywhere , establish connexions everywhere . The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country . To the great chagrin of Reactionists , it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood . All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed . They are dislodged by new industries , whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations , by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material , but raw material drawn from the remotest zones ; industries whose products are consumed , not only at home , but in every quarter of the globe . In place of the old wants , satisfied by the production of the country , we find new wants , requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes . In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency , we have intercourse in every direction , universal inter-dependence of nations . And as in material , so also in intellectual production . The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property . National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible , and from the numerous national and local literatures , there arises a world literature . The bourgeoisie , by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production , by the immensely facilitated means of communication , draws all , even the most barbarian , nations into civilisation . The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls , with which it forces the barbarians ’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate . It compels all nations , on pain of extinction , to adopt the bourgeois mode of production ; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst , i. e. , to become bourgeois themselves . In one word , it creates a world after its own image . The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns . It has created enormous cities , has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural , and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life . Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns , so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones , nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois , the East on the West . The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population , of the means of production , and of property . It has agglomerated population , centralised the means of production , and has concentrated property in a few hands . The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation . Independent , or but loosely connected provinces , with separate interests , laws , governments , and systems of taxation , became lumped together into one nation , with one government , one code of laws , one national class-interest , one frontier , and one customs-tariff . The bourgeoisie , during its rule of scarce one hundred years , has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together . Subjection of Nature’s forces to man , machinery , application of chemistry to industry and agriculture , steam-navigation , railways , electric telegraphs , clearing of whole continents for cultivation , canalisation of rivers , whole populations conjured out of the ground – what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour ? We see then : the means of production and of exchange , on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up , were generated in feudal society . At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange , the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged , the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry , in one word , the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces ; they became so many fetters . They had to be burst asunder ; they were burst asunder . Into their place stepped free competition , accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it , and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class . A similar movement is going on before our own eyes . Modern bourgeois society , with its relations of production , of exchange and of property , a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange , is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells . For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production , against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule . It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial , each time more threateningly . In these crises , a great part not only of the existing products , but also of the previously created productive forces , are periodically destroyed . In these crises , there breaks out an epidemic that , in all earlier epochs , would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of over-production . Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism ; it appears as if a famine , a universal war of devastation , had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence ; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed ; and why ? Because there is too much civilisation , too much means of subsistence , too much industry , too much commerce . The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property ; on the contrary , they have become too powerful for these conditions , by which they are fettered , and so soon as they overcome these fetters , they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society , endanger the existence of bourgeois property . The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them . And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises ? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces ; on the other , by the conquest of new markets , and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones . That is to say , by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises , and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented . The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself . But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself ; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons – the modern working class – the proletarians . In proportion as the bourgeoisie , i. e. , capital , is developed , in the same proportion is the proletariat , the modern working class , developed – a class of labourers , who live only so long as they find work , and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital . These labourers , who must sell themselves piecemeal , are a commodity , like every other article of commerce , and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition , to all the fluctuations of the market . Owing to the extensive use of machinery , and to the division of labour , the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character , and , consequently , all charm for the workman . He becomes an appendage of the machine , and it is only the most simple , most monotonous , and most easily acquired knack , that is required of him . Hence , the cost of production of a workman is restricted , almost entirely , to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance , and for the propagation of his race . But the price of a commodity , and therefore also of labour , is equal to its cost of production . In proportion , therefore , as the repulsiveness of the work increases , the wage decreases . Nay more , in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases , in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases , whether by prolongation of the working hours , by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery , etc. Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist . Masses of labourers , crowded into the factory , are organised like soldiers . As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants . Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class , and of the bourgeois State ; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine , by the overlooker , and , above all , by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself . The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim , the more petty , the more hateful and the more embittering it is . The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour , in other words , the more modern industry becomes developed , the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women . Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class . All are instruments of labour , more or less expensive to use , according to their age and sex . No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer , so far , at an end , that he receives his wages in cash , than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie , the landlord , the shopkeeper , the pawnbroker , etc. The lower strata of the middle class – the small tradespeople , shopkeepers , and retired tradesmen generally , the handicraftsmen and peasants – all these sink gradually into the proletariat , partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on , and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists , partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production . Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population . The proletariat goes through various stages of development . With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie . At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers , then by the workpeople of a factory , then by the operative of one trade , in one locality , against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them . They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production , but against the instruments of production themselves ; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour , they smash to pieces machinery , they set factories ablaze , they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages . At this stage , the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country , and broken up by their mutual competition . If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies , this is not yet the consequence of their own active union , but of the union of the bourgeoisie , which class , in order to attain its own political ends , is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion , and is moreover yet , for a time , able to do so . At this stage , therefore , the proletarians do not fight their enemies , but the enemies of their enemies , the remnants of absolute monarchy , the landowners , the non-industrial bourgeois , the petty bourgeois . Thus , the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie ; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie . But with the development of industry , the proletariat not only increases in number ; it becomes concentrated in greater masses , its strength grows , and it feels that strength more . The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised , in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour , and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level . The growing competition among the bourgeois , and the resulting commercial crises , make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating . The increasing improvement of machinery , ever more rapidly developing , makes their livelihood more and more precarious ; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes . Thereupon , the workers begin to form combinations ( Trades ’ Unions ) against the bourgeois ; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages ; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts . Here and there , the contest breaks out into riots . Now and then the workers are victorious , but only for a time . The real fruit of their battles lies , not in the immediate result , but in the ever expanding union of the workers . This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry , and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another . It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles , all of the same character , into one national struggle between classes . But every class struggle is a political struggle . And that union , to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages , with their miserable highways , required centuries , the modern proletarian , thanks to railways , achieve in a few years . This organisation of the proletarians into a class , and , consequently into a political party , is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves . But it ever rises up again , stronger , firmer , mightier . It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers , by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself . Thus , the ten-hours ’ bill in England was carried . Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further , in many ways , the course of development of the proletariat . The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle . At first with the aristocracy ; later on , with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself , whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry ; at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries . In all these battles , it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat , to ask for help , and thus , to drag it into the political arena . The bourgeoisie itself , therefore , supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education , in other words , it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie . Further , as we have already seen , entire sections of the ruling class are , by the advance of industry , precipitated into the proletariat , or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence . These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress . Finally , in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour , the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class , in fact within the whole range of old society , assumes such a violent , glaring character , that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift , and joins the revolutionary class , the class that holds the future in its hands . Just as , therefore , at an earlier period , a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie , so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat , and in particular , a portion of the bourgeois ideologists , who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole . Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today , the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class . The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry ; the proletariat is its special and essential product . The lower middle class , the small manufacturer , the shopkeeper , the artisan , the peasant , all these fight against the bourgeoisie , to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class . They are therefore not revolutionary , but conservative . Nay more , they are reactionary , for they try to roll back the wheel of history . If by chance , they are revolutionary , they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat ; they thus defend not their present , but their future interests , they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat . The “ dangerous class ” , [ lumpenproletariat ] the social scum , that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society , may , here and there , be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution ; its conditions of life , however , prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue . In the condition of the proletariat , those of old society at large are already virtually swamped . The proletarian is without property ; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations ; modern industry labour , modern subjection to capital , the same in England as in France , in America as in Germany , has stripped him of every trace of national character . Law , morality , religion , are to him so many bourgeois prejudices , behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests . All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation . The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society , except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation , and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation . They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify ; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for , and insurances of , individual property . All previous historical movements were movements of minorities , or in the interest of minorities . The proletarian movement is the self-conscious , independent movement of the immense majority , in the interest of the immense majority . The proletariat , the lowest stratum of our present society , cannot stir , cannot raise itself up , without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air . Though not in substance , yet in form , the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle . The proletariat of each country must , of course , first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie . In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat , we traced the more or less veiled civil war , raging within existing society , up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution , and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat . Hitherto , every form of society has been based , as we have already seen , on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes . But in order to oppress a class , certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can , at least , continue its slavish existence . The serf , in the period of serfdom , raised himself to membership in the commune , just as the petty bourgeois , under the yoke of the feudal absolutism , managed to develop into a bourgeois . The modern labourer , on the contrary , instead of rising with the process of industry , sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class . He becomes a pauper , and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth . And here it becomes evident , that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society , and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law . It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery , because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state , that it has to feed him , instead of being fed by him . Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie , in other words , its existence is no longer compatible with society . The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital ; the condition for capital is wage-labour . Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers . The advance of industry , whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie , replaces the isolation of the labourers , due to competition , by the revolutionary combination , due to association . The development of Modern Industry , therefore , cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products . What the bourgeoisie therefore produces , above all , are its own grave-diggers . Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable .
