Residents and businesses in the Powys part of the Dyfi Valley are being invited to help create an action plan that will improve the quality of life and vitality of the area . Each of the four public events planned for July will focus on a specific theme and will bring together the two community organisations that have been researching local needs . Each meeting will also discuss the relevant section of the draft Powys Community Strategy . The Communities First process in Machynlleth , Cadfarch , Glantwymyn and Llanbrynmair is entering a new phase . A lot of suggestions concerning the future of the Dyfi valley have been gathered during the community consultations . Equally , many people in the same area have contributed their ideas during the events organised by the Local Community Forum ( part of the community strategy process in Powys ) . Andy Rowland is the Chair of the Forum . " All these ideas have been sorted into a number of themes " , he explained , " but now we need to turn them into a draft action plan for the area . " This means deciding which ones will make a real difference , who will bring them about and how soon , as well as seeing what kind of vision they add up to .
