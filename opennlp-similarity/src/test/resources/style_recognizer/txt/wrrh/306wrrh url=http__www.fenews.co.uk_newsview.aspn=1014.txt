The report , entitled ' Transitions ' , includes not only some startling research results concerning suicide rates , using ASBOs inefficiently and the cost to the state of failing young people and not bringing them back into the workforce , but also some details of the measures to be taken by a cross - Governmental action . And a government minister spoke about the report as a necessary document given the new and difficult environment facing young people in this transition today . Generation Gap The Minister of State responsible for the SEU and Local Government , Mr . Phil Woolas MP , spoke of the need to recognise the change that society as a whole has undergone and the consequences of this , saying : ' For my generation - and my parents ' generation - the transition from adolescence to adulthood was relatively straightforward : leave school , get a job , leave mum and dad 's home , get married , start a family . But these days - as the SEU report shows - the transition is more complicated - and more difficult . ' Speaking of the need for better advice and guidance for the young people , he said : ' All young people need help and advice during this critical stage of their lives . Important decisions have to be made - decisions about work and education , for example . But for vulnerable and disadvantaged young people that advice can sometimes be lacking - and this can result in existing disadvantage being passed from one generation to the next . Trust and Respect The report raises the issue of respect and responsibility and the need to enhance these amongst the young people concerned . This is a sentiment that Mr . Woolas shared : ' For me , one of the key points in the SEU report is the focus on the need for a disadvantaged young adult to have trust in someone they respect - and who respects them . Someone who can support and advise them - but also challenge their thinking . This is crucial . And it is one way that all young people can experience a successful and happy adult life . ' He stated that the Government is entirely commited to effecting the changes outlined in the report , saying : ' The SEU report Transitions shows how seriously the government takes this . The actions show that this is a cross government initiative to help get young adults lives back on track . ' Projects to Build On Jane Slowey , Chief Executive of the Foyer Federation , also welcomed the report , saying : ' This report is a positive step towards treating young people according to the stage they have reached , rather than just their age . Too many disadvantaged young people are being failed in their early twenties , a time when many are most in need of support to help them move into education , training and work . ' Young people living in projects such as Foyers often face what seem like insurmountable barriers to get them back into a positive cycle and help them progress . ' She concluded with a message to the Government , warning them of the need for imnmediate and sustained action : ' Government now needs to act on the evidence presented in this report and elsewhere to ensure that all young people have the chance to realise their full potential .
