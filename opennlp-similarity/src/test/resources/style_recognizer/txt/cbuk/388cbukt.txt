Deafness : the facts Hearing aids How do I get a hearing aid on the NHS ? How do I get a hearing aid on the NHS ? If you are having difficulty hearing and think you might benefit from hearing aids , visit your family doctor , who may refer you to an audiology ( hearing aid ) department depending on local arrangements and what other symptoms you may have . Do n't forget to mention all possible relevant symptoms to your GP and specialist , for example , if you are experiencing noises in the ear or having difficulties with balance . All NHS ENT and Audiology departments will have a waiting period . If your GP refers you to an audiologist , you will go on a waiting list for an appointment . UK citizens and residents are entitled to free hearing aids through the NHS . However , if you are in a hurry to get aids , or want a particular type of aid that is not available through the NHS , an alternative is to go to a private hearing aid dispenser or audiology department . Some NHS audiology clinics have links with private clinics and may be able to offer guidance , or you can contact the Deafness Research UK Information Service . Before your first audiology appointment It is best to take the person you have the most conversation with along too , particularly if you are worried about being able to hear the audiologist . This will help the audiologist adjust the hearing aid to the voice you hear most often , and you will both understand the process involved in getting , using and adjusting to , your hearing aid . Ask the audiologist to speak slowly and more clearly if you cannot hear them . Think about which situations you have trouble hearing in . For example , one-to-one , watching television , hearing when you are with several friends , certain types of voices ? What to expect at your first appointment It will be explained what tests you are having . It will be explained if you need a hearing aid in one or both ears and why . Your audiologist will write down the name and type of hearing aid you are getting , and whether it is a digital or analogue aid . Your audiologist will show you your audiogram and explain the extent of your hearing loss . Your audiologist will show you how to care for your aid and how it works . Initial testing At your first audiology appointment , your medical history will be taken , your ears will be examined and your hearing tested . The main test is to find out the quietest sounds that you can hear at different pitches or frequencies , presented either over earphones or via a vibrator attached to your head . Additionally , a detailed questionnaire of your listening needs will normally be carried out . These simple tests will determine whether you need one hearing aid or two . If you need an aid , an impression of your ear will be taken , which will be used to create your earmould for your hearing aid . You will return several weeks later to get your aid fitted . At the initial appointment you will be asked a list of questions about your hearing to help determine how best to adjust your aid for different situations . Ask your audiologist to print out a copy for you so that you are able to monitor the situations where you have difficulty hearing . Keep a list of all the different situations you have difficulty hearing in and tell the audiologist at your fitting appointment . The more information you can give the audiologist about the different situations that you have difficulty hearing in , or hear well in , the better they will be able to adjust the hearing aid for your individual needs . Fitting Once your hearing aid is ready , you will return for a fitting appointment . Most people will receive one hearing aid , but in some cases the type of hearing loss ( bilateral ) makes it more beneficial for the patient to receive two aids . However , resource limitations mean that not everyone who would benefit from two hearing aids will get them . Your aid will be chosen to suit the degree and type of hearing loss you have . You will be shown how to put in the earmould . You will also be shown how to operate the controls and how to change the batteries . Your audiologist will help you to manage your hearing loss , improve your communication skills and enable you to participate fully in daily activities . Follow up care You will have a follow-up appointment around 6 to 12 weeks after your fitting appointment . Here you can discuss any problems you may be experiencing and any necessary adjustments will be made to the earmould and/or the programming of the hearing aid . For example , you may still have trouble hearing individual voices in noisy situations , or the aid may be amplifying sound too much in some situations . At this appointment , you may also get further information about getting used to , and looking after , the hearing aid . After your follow-up appointment you will not normally be sent another audiological appointment unless you request one . However , some audiology departments conduct a routine follow up after a period of one or two years . If you are not happy with the sounds the hearing aid produces and this is stopping you using it in all the situations you want to , you should request another appointment to make further adjustments to your hearing aid . Ongoing support You do n't usually need an appointment to get new hearing aid batteries . Check with your local department when facilities are available as opening times can vary . These are supplied free of charge from your local audiology department and may be available from local GP surgeries and health centres . If you have ongoing problems adjusting to your hearing aid , check if there is a hearing therapist in your area . They can offer ongoing support in helping you to manage your hearing loss , improve your communication skills and enable you to participate fully in daily activities . You can be referred by your family doctor or check with your local audiology department . If your hearing aid or earmould needs repairing you may or may not need an appointment , depending on local policy .
