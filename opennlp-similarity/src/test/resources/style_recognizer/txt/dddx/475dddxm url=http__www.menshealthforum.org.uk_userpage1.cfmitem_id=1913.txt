Monday , 08 May 2006 Good Lord , it 's MHF patron Kamlesh Congratulations to MHF patron Professor Kamlesh Patel who has , in the parlance , been elevated to the peerage . He was one of the seven new non-party-political peers recommended by the House of Lords Appointments Commission this week . Whatever one 's views on a non-elected second chamber built on patronage and inheritance in a modern democracy , the Commission could not have chosen a better man . The Forum wishes him every success in his new role . Kanmlesh who is Head of the Centre for Ethnicity and Health at the University of Central Lancashire is also Chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission and National Director and Chairman of the Government 's Black and Minority Ethnic Mental Health Programme Board .
