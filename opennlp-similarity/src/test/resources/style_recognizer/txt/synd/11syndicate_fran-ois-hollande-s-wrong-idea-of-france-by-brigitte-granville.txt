François Hollande’s Wrong Idea of France LONDON – France’s new president , François Hollande , has achieved a remarkable series of political victories – at home and in Europe – since his election in May . Unfortunately , his streak of success will inevitably call forth an economic reckoning that will shock France’s apparently unsuspecting citizens and doom the French elite’s approach to the “ construction of Europe . ” Since winning the presidency , Hollande has won a parliamentary majority and pushed Germany toward accepting joint liability for eurozone countries ’ debts . But forebodings of crisis have become widespread in French business and economic circles . But the real danger – which even Hollande’s sternest critics may be underestimating – is not so much his individual policy failings ( serious though they may be ) as his approach to the twin challenges posed by France’s economic imbalances and the eurozone crisis . On each front separately , he might manage to muddle through ; together , they look likely to cement France’s loss of competitiveness . Declining competitiveness is best captured in a single indicator : unit labor costs , which measure the average cost of labor per unit of output . In a monetary union , discrepancies in wage growth relative to productivity gains – that is , unit labor costs – will result in a chronic accumulation of trade surpluses or deficits . Since the euro’s introduction , unit labor costs have risen dramatically faster in France than they have in Germany . According to Eurostat data published in April 2011 , the hourly labor cost in France was €34.2 , compared to €30.1 in Germany – and nearly 20 % higher than the eurozone average of €27.6 . France’s current-account deficit has risen to more than 2 % of GDP , even as its economic growth has ground to a halt . The high cost of employing workers in France is due not so much to wages and benefits as it is to payroll taxes levied on employers . The entire French political class has long delighted in taxing labor to finance the country’s generous welfare provisions , thus avoiding excessively high taxation of individuals ’ income and consumption – though that is about to come to an end as Hollande intends to slap a 75 % tax on incomes above €1 million . This is a version of the fallacy that taxing companies ( “ capital ” ) spares ordinary people ( “ workers ” ) . Of course , such taxes on firms are always passed on to households – usually through straightforward price hikes , and , in France , also through unemployment . High tax rates on labor – together with rigid regulation of hiring and firing – make employers extremely reluctant to recruit workers . As a result , France has had chronic long-term unemployment – forecast to reach 10.5 % by 2013 – for many years . Hollande’s predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , tried to address this problem . He exempted voluntary overtime pay from employment tax and shifted some of the burden of labor taxation onto consumption ( via a hike in VAT ) . But Hollande quickly reversed both of these reforms . The repeal of the tax break on overtime reflects another economic fallacy to which French Socialist politicians are deeply attached : the “ lump of labor ” notion that underlay the most disastrous of their economic policies – the 35-hour workweek , introduced in 2000. The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant , and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment . Such measures , designed to create jobs by freeing up work hours , are futile at best , and are often detrimental . French Socialists should recall their school physics lesson about communicating vessels : when a homogeneous liquid is poured into a set of connected containers , it settles at the same level in all of them , regardless of their shape and volume . Generating more “ liquid ” ( jobs ) requires not discouraging the entrepreneurs on whose activities sustainable job creation ultimately depends . The effect of fiscal and regulatory pressure on employment is to encourage French firms to invest and hire outside France . Hollande’s apologists praise his gradualist and consensual approach to addressing the economy’s structural distortions . They argue that his penchant for setting up consultative commissions is the best way to forge the consensus required for structural reform , whereas Sarkozy’s combative style was counterproductive . Even banishing skepticism and assuming that Hollande could over time persuade his supporters to embrace competitiveness-boosting policies , the eurozone crisis is denying France the time that such gradualism requires . A simple , effective way to buy time would be to abandon the euro and restore competitiveness through a devalued national currency . But this expedient is incompatible with mainstream French politicians ’ devotion to the “ European project , ” which amounts to a projection of French soft power ; indeed , building Europe lies at the heart of the French establishment’s version of what Charles de Gaulle used to call “ a certain idea of France . ” For mainstream French politicians , renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative : an all-out push for full European political union . This would reestablish monetary sovereignty and create a normal central bank ( like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England ) at the European level . But it would also mean abandoning France’s republic in favor of a federal European government – anathema to that “ certain idea of France . ” The combination of gradualism ( on the most generous interpretation ) in domestic economic reform and the paralyzing effect of the eurozone crisis will lead to a massive shock . Remaining in a currency union with the much more competitive German economy will require wrenching and rapid reforms , for which Hollande’s tepid approach will fail to prepare the complacent French . The result will be even more support than was seen in last April’s presidential election for extremist political parties that reject both Europe and competitive market capitalism .
