E.2242/98-99 Chapter 1 : Hospital , Community Health and Ambulance Trusts Case No . E. 2242/98-99 - Inadequate arrangements for care following discharge ; inadequate response to request for independent review Complaint against : Lincoln and Louth NHS Trust Summary of case Mrs P was treated by the Trust for a broken hip following a fall at home in April 1997 . Her son , Mr L , complained that , despite the family 's concerns that she was becoming increasingly confused , Mrs P was discharged without a psychiatric assessment . The Ombudsman 's professional assessors concluded that Mrs P 's pre-discharge assessment was adequate ; her discharge was appropriately planned ; and the necessary support for her discharge home was put in place . The Ombudsman did not uphold this aspect of the complaint . Mr L also complained about the Trust 's handling of two requests he made for independent review ( IR ) . The Ombudsman concluded that the Trust did not deal adequately with either request . They failed to refer the first to the convener , as required by national guidance , and instead attempted further local resolution . When this was unsuccessful and Mr L made a second request for IR , the Trust failed to respond because of staffing difficulties and procedural weaknesses . This aspect of the complaint was upheld . The Trust apologised to Mr L and confirmed that they had taken steps to improve complaint handling procedures .
