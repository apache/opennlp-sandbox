Hello : We 're doing my grandmothers genealogy - Knight/Morrison from Peterhead . William Morrison married Isabella Knight on 6-8-1892 in Peterhead . They had 7 children - Louisa , William , Jemina , George , Alex , Jack and Isabella . Jemina Helen was my grandmother , b. in Peterhead on 5-16-1899 - passed away in USA in the 1980 's . Jemina married David Donald Middleton in the USA in 1923 . If you think you may have a family connection or could give me any info on where to start my search on the Morrison/Knight their time in Scotland , would be glad to hear from on and all . Thanks so much ! ! Sandi USA
