Do not try to configure the GPS navigation software while driving . • The plotted GPS route is only for driving reference . It should not interfere with actual driving behavior . 192 Navigating on the Road • Do not leave your device in a vehicle or expose the device to direct sunlight to avoid overheating the battery , which could pose damage to the device or risk to the vehicle . • When using the device inside a vehicle , use the car holder to mount the device securely in place . Avoid placing the device in the areas shown in the following diagram : 1 Do not place where it will block the driver’s vision . 2 Do not place where air bags could deploy . 3 Do not place anywhere in the vehicle without securing the device in the holder . • Use the GPS system cautiously . Users shall be liable for any damages resulting from negligent operation of the system . • The GPS signal cannot pass through solid non-transparent objects . Signal reception may be affected by obstructions such as high-rise buildings , tunnels , bridges , forests , weather ( rainy or cloudy days ) , etc. If the vehicle’s visor contains metal , it will be difficult for the GPS signal to pass through . • Other nearby wireless communication products ( such as mobile phones or radar-detecting devices ) may interfere with the satellite signal , resulting in unstable signal reception . Navigating on the Road 193 • The Global Positioning System ( GPS ) is built and operated by the US Defense Department . The Department is responsible for the accuracy and maintenance of the system . Any changes that the Department makes may affect the accuracy and function of the GPS system . 10.3 Downloading Location Data via QuickGPS Before using the device for GPS navigation , open QuickGPS to download ephemeris data ( current satellite position and timing information ) .
