Schools are able to screen pupils for weapons using " arch " and " wand " metal detectors , the government has said , after a quick check of what the law actually says on such issues . Education Secretary Alan Johnson is also giving headteachers and school staff new powers to search pupils for weapons as part of his policy to ensure schools are " knife and weapon free " zones and safe and secure places to learn . Staff will be able to use blanket non-contact or minimal contact screening for weapons without needing consent or grounds of suspicion to do so . Random checks could be used to catch offenders unawares . If screening arouses suspicion that a pupil is carrying a weapon , school staff will then be able to use the new powers in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to carry out a hands-on search . Screening involves pupils walking through a " bleeping " arch or being checked with a metal detector wand . Heads will still be able to call in the police if they need to in order to deal with incidents .
