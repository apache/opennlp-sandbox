Article 4 Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights , obligations and responsibilities of States and individuals under international law , in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law . The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict , as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law , which are governed by that law are not governed by this Convention , and the activities undertaken by military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties , inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law , are not governed by this Convention .

Article 7 States Parties shall cooperate by : ( a ) Taking all practicable measures , including , if necessary , adapting their national law , to prevent and counter preparations in their respective territories for the commission within or outside their territories of the offences set forth in article 2 , including measures to prohibit in their territories illegal activities of persons , groups and organizations that encourage , instigate , organize , knowingly finance or knowingly provide technical assistance or information or engage in the perpetration of those offences ; ( b ) Exchanging accurate and verified information in accordance with their national law and in the manner of and subject to the conditions specified herein , and coordinating administrative and other measures taken as appropriate to detect , prevent , suppress and investigate the offences set forth in article 2 and also in order to institute criminal proceedings against persons alleged to have committed those crimes . In particular , a State Party shall take appropriate measures in order to inform without delay the other States referred to in article 9 in respect of the commission of the offences set forth in article 2 as well as preparations to commit such offences about which it has learned , and also to inform , where appropriate , international organizations . States Parties shall take appropriate measures consistent with their national law to protect the confidentiality of any information which they receive in confidence by virtue of the provisions of this Convention from another State Party or through participation in an activity carried out for the implementation of this Convention . If States Parties provide information to international organizations in confidence , steps shall be taken to ensure that the confidentiality of such information is protected .

Should any change take place , the State Party concerned shall immediately notify the Secretary-General . Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 2 in cases where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite that person to any of the States Parties which have established their jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of the present article . This Convention does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a State Party in accordance with its national law . Article 10 Upon receiving information that an offence set forth in article 2 has been committed or is being committed in the territory of a State Party or that a person who has committed or who is alleged to have committed such an offence may be present in its territory , the State Party concerned shall take such measures as may be necessary under its national law to investigate the facts contained in the information . Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant , the State Party in whose territory the offender or alleged offender is present shall take the appropriate measures under its national law so as to ensure that person 's presence for the purpose of prosecution or extradition . Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 2 of the present article are being taken shall be entitled to : ( a ) Communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which that person is a national or which is otherwise entitled to protect that person 's rights or , if that person is a stateless person , the State in the territory of which that person habitually resides ; ( b ) Be visited by a representative of that State ; ( c ) Be informed of that person 's rights under subparagraphs ( a ) and ( b ) . The rights referred to in paragraph 3 of the present article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the State in the territory of which the offender or alleged offender is present , subject to the provision that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under paragraph 3 are intended . The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the present article shall be without prejudice to the right of any State Party having a claim to jurisdiction in accordance with article 9 , subparagraph 1 ( c ) or 2 ( c ) , to invite the International Committee of the Red Cross to communicate with and visit the alleged offender . When a State Party , pursuant to the present article , has taken a person into custody , it shall immediately notify , directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations , the States Parties which have established jurisdiction in accordance with article 9 , paragraphs 1 and 2 and , if it considers it advisable , any other interested States Parties , of the fact that that person is in custody and of the circumstances which warrant that person 's detention . The State which makes the investigation contemplated in paragraph 1 of the present article shall promptly inform the said States Parties of its findings and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction . Article 11 The State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present shall , in cases to which article 9 applies , if it does not extradite that person , be obliged , without exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory , to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution , through proceedings in accordance with the laws of that State . Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the law of that State . Whenever a State Party is permitted under its national law to extradite or otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought , and this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms they may deem appropriate , such a conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 1 of the present article . Article 12 Any person who is taken into custody or regarding whom any other measures are taken or proceedings are carried out pursuant to this Convention shall be guaranteed fair treatment , including enjoyment of all rights and guarantees in conformity with the law of the State in the territory of which that person is present and applicable provisions of international law , including international law of human rights . Article 13 The offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention . States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between them . When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty , the requested State Party may , at its option , consider this Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 2. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State . States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 2 as extraditable offences between themselves , subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State . If necessary , the offences set forth in article 2 shall be treated , for the purposes of extradition between States Parties , as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have established jurisdiction in accordance with article 9 , paragraphs 1 and 2. The provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements between States Parties with regard to offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be modified as between States Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention . Article 14 States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in article 2 , including assistance in obtaining evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings . States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of the present article in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them . In the absence of such treaties or arrangements , States Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their national law . Article 15 None of the offences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded , for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance , as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives . Accordingly , a request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an offence may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives . Article 16 Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person 's position for any of these reasons . Article 17 A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of testimony , identification or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the investigation or prosecution of offences under this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met : ( a ) The person freely gives his or her informed consent ; and ( b ) The competent authorities of both States agree , subject to such conditions as those States may deem appropriate . For the purposes of the present article : ( a ) The State to which the person is transferred shall have the authority and obligation to keep the person transferred in custody , unless otherwise requested or authorized by the State from which the person was transferred ; ( b ) The State to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to return the person to the custody of the State from which the person was transferred as agreed beforehand , or as otherwise agreed , by the competent authorities of both States ; ( c ) The State to which the person is transferred shall not require the State from which the person was transferred to initiate extradition proceedings for the return of the person ; ( d ) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State from which he was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State to which he was transferred . Unless the State Party from which a person is to be transferred in accordance with the present article so agrees , that person , whatever his or her nationality , shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts or convictions anterior to his or her departure from the territory of the State from which such person was transferred . Article 18 Upon seizing or otherwise taking control of radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities , following the commission of an offence set forth in article 2 , the State Party in possession of it shall : ( a ) Take steps to render harmless the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility ; ( b ) Ensure that any nuclear material is held in accordance with applicable International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards ; and ( c ) Have regard to physical protection recommendations and health and safety standards published by the International Atomic Energy Agency . Upon the completion of any proceedings connected with an offence set forth in article 2 , or sooner if required by international law , any radioactive material , device or nuclear facility shall be returned , after consultations ( in particular , regarding modalities of return and storage ) with the States Parties concerned to the State Party to which it belongs , to the State Party of which the natural or legal person owning such radioactive material , device or facility is a national or resident , or to the State Party from whose territory it was stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained . 3(1 ) Where a State Party is prohibited by national or international law from returning or accepting such radioactive material , device or nuclear facility or where the States Parties concerned so agree , subject to paragraph 3(2 ) of the present article , the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall continue to take the steps described in paragraph 1 of the present article ; such radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall be used only for peaceful purposes . 3(2 ) Where it is not lawful for the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities to possess them , that State shall ensure that they are as soon as possible placed in the possession of a State for which such possession is lawful and which , where appropriate , has provided assurances consistent with the requirements of paragraph 1 of the present article in consultation with that State , for the purpose of rendering it harmless ; such radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall be used only for peaceful purposes . If the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the present article do not belong to any of the States Parties or to a national or resident of a State Party or was not stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained from the territory of a State Party , or if no State is willing to receive such item pursuant to paragraph 3 of the present article , a separate decision concerning its disposition shall , subject to paragraph 3(2 ) of the present article , be taken after consultations between the States concerned and any relevant international organizations . For the purposes of paragraphs 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the present article , the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility may request the assistance and cooperation of other States Parties , in particular the States Parties concerned , and any relevant international organizations , in particular the International Atomic Energy Agency . States Parties and the relevant international organizations are encouraged to provide assistance pursuant to this paragraph to the maximum extent possible . The States Parties involved in the disposition or retention of the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility pursuant to the present article shall inform the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the manner in which such an item was disposed of or retained . The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency shall transmit the information to the other States Parties . In the event of any dissemination in connection with an offence set forth in article 2 , nothing in the present article shall affect in any way the rules of international law governing liability for nuclear damage , or other rules of international law . Article 19 The State Party where the alleged offender is prosecuted shall , in accordance with its national law or applicable procedures , communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations , who shall transmit the information to the other States Parties . Article 20 States Parties shall conduct consultations with one another directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations , with the assistance of international organizations as necessary , to ensure effective implementation of this Convention . Article 21 The States Parties shall carry out their obligations under this Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States . Article 22 Nothing in this Convention entitles a State Party to undertake in the territory of another State Party the exercise of jurisdiction and performance of functions which are exclusively reserved for the authorities of that other State Party by its national law . Article 23 Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which cannot be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time shall , at the request of one of them , be submitted to arbitration . If , within six months from the date of the request for arbitration , the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration , any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice , by application , in conformity with the Statute of the Court . Each State may , at the time of signature , ratification , acceptance or approval of this Convention or accession thereto , declare that it does not consider itself bound by paragraph 1 of the present article .
