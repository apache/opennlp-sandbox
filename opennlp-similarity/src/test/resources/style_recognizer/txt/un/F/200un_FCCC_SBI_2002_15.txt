Report of the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention Note by the secretariat* Contents Paragraphs Page Mandate The Conference of the Parties ( COP ) , at its fifth session , by its decision 8/CP.5 , decided to establish the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention ( CGE ) , with the objective of improving the preparation of national communications from these Parties ( non-Annex I Parties ) . In order to fulfil this objective , the COP , in the annex to this decision , mandated the CGE to : Exchange experience and information on the preparation of national communications , including consideration of subregional experience , through meetings and workshops , on the basis of agendas prepared in consultation with the participants ; Consider , as appropriate , the needs for and availability of financial resources and technical support , and the identification of barriers to and gaps in this support ; Consider , as appropriate , information in national communications from non-Annex I Parties in accordance with the guidelines for the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties contained in the annex to decision 10/CP.2 ; Review existing activities and programmes to facilitate and support the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties with a view to identifying gaps and making recommendations to better coordinate these activities and programmes in order to enhance the preparation of national communications ; Identify the difficulties encountered by non-Annex I Parties in the use of the guidelines contained in the annex to decision 10/CP.2 and in the use of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) methodologies and other models , and make recommendations for improvement where appropriate ; Identify the analytical and methodological issues , including technical problems in the preparation and reporting of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) inventories , in particular with respect to the improvement of data collection , the development of local and regional emission factors and activity data , and the development of methodologies , where appropriate , with a view to enhancing the quality of future inventories ; Examine national communications , in particular greenhouse gas inventories , submitted by non-Annex I Parties , with a view to arriving at recommendations on ways of overcoming difficulties in the use of the IPCC methodologies and the UNFCCC guidelines relating to inventories contained in the annex to decision 10/CP.2 , and on possible innovations , and produce reports thereon ; Encourage interaction among experts from all Parties . The COP further , at it seventh session , in decision 31/CP.7 , decided that the CGE shall continue to have the objective of improving the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties . By the same decision , the COP also decided that in addition to its mandate contained in the annex to decision 8/CP.5 , as outlined above , the CGE shall identify and assess technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them , and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies , and shall also provide input to the draft improved guidelines for the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties . The COP , pursuant to decision 31/CP.7 , mandated the CGE to conduct two workshops during 2002 , with the objective of sharing experiences to ensure adequate coverage of issues referred to in paragraph 2 above . Scope of the report This document contains a summary of the main issues , technical problems and constraints relating to the preparation of national communications and those that have particularly affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them ( section III ) , and the activities and programmes that facilitated and supported the preparation of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties ( section IV ) . Section V outlines the recommendations made by the CGE for the improvement of the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Possible actions by the subsidiary bodies The Subsidiary Body for Implementation ( SBI ) may wish to take note of the information presented in this document with a view to improving the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . In particular , the SBI may wish to recommend to the COP , a draft decision on further guidance for the future work of the CGE in improving the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . In addition , the SBI may wish to consider the recommendations made by the CGE , contained in this report , and make these recommendations available , through the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice , to the IPCC , with a view to developing appropriate methods , tools and models for use in non-Annex I Parties . The SBI may also wish to consider the information contained in this document and make available recommendations , through the COP , to the bilateral and multilateral support programmes to provide additional financial resources and technical support for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Organization of work Pursuant to decisions 8/CP.5 and 31/CP.7 , the CGE held five meetings , each immediately prior to sessions of the subsidiary bodies , and six workshops , between May 2000 and August 2002. The issues discussed at the meetings of the CGE included the consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the CGE workshops aimed at the improvement of the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties , development of work plans , examination of the information presented in national communications submitted by non-Annex I Parties , and preparation of the CGE reports for consideration by the subsidiary bodies . The reports of four meetings are contained in documents FCCC/SBI/2000/16 , FCCC/SBI/2001/2 , FCCC/SBI/2001/3 , and FCCC/SBI/2002/2 . The report of the fifth meeting was presented by the CGE Chair as an oral report to the subsidiary bodies at their sixteenth session , and is contained in the annex to this document . The six workshops were conducted by the CGE members with the support of the secretariat to facilitate the exchange of experiences between non-Annex I Parties , within and between each developing region , on the preparation of each of the elements of the national communication , so as to identify problems and constraints relating to analytical , technical and methodological issues , and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies to overcome these problems and constraints . A total of 105 experts nominated by 70 non-Annex I Parties , 9 experts from 8 Annex I Parties and 12 representatives from 4 bilateral and 8 multilateral agencies participated in the workshops . The elements of a national communication considered at the workshops were national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment , research and systematic observation , GHG mitigation analysis , education , training and public awareness , information and networking , and financial and technical support . In view of the need to analyse information pertaining to each of the elements of a national communication , the CGE divided itself into six task groups to cover : national GHG inventory ; vulnerability and adaptation assessment and research and systematic observation ; GHG mitigation analysis ; education , training and public awareness ; information and networking ; and financial and technical support . The task groups , each facilitated by a coordinator , analysed information presented in 81 initial national communications , and in CGE meetings and workshops . The CGE members also made active use of the CGE listserv , developed and maintained by the secretariat , to exchange views on various issues pertaining to the discharge of its work . The work of the CGE was supported by the secretariat which provided administrative and technical support , and prepared its reports . The CGE , in fulfilling its mandate and terms of reference , contained in the annex to decision 8/CP.5 , examined information contained in the first compilation and synthesis report ( FCCC/SBI/1999/11 ) and in the 50 initial national communications which had been officially submitted to the secretariat between June 2000 and March 2001. A report on this work was completed and submitted to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth session ( FCCC/SBI/2001/15 ) . In that report , conclusions and recommendations were made by the CGE relating to the improvement of the preparation of the various elements of the national communication , including the recommendations for the improvement of the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties contained in the annex to decision 10/CP.2 ( UNFCCC guidelines ) . Since the completion of that report , the CGE was mandated by the COP ( decision 31/CP.7 ) to continue its work to improve the process of the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . To this end , it examined , together with the previous 50 initial national communications , an additional 31 communications submitted between April 2001 and June 2002 , in accordance with the annex to decision 8/CP.5 . Additionally , the CGE identified technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them , in accordance with decision 31/CP.7 . Data and information The most common problem/constraint encountered by non-Annex I Parties in the preparation of their national communications was related to the scarcity and quality of data ( for example , availability , accessibility and reliability ) in all the relevant areas of the national communications . This problem was exacerbated by lack of capacities and expertise to access , collect , analyse , manipulate and manage the data and databases necessary to conduct these studies and analyses . In almost all relevant categories of GHG sources and sinks ( energy , industrial processes , agriculture , land-use change and forestry , and waste ) most Parties found that there was lack of and/or deficiencies in the activity data . This is particularly true in the informal and household sectors of the economy , as well as on gases such as hydrofluorocarbons ( HFC ) , perfluorocarbons ( PFC ) and sulphur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) . Some Parties found that the lack of disaggregation of data on fuel consumption in the industrial and transport sectors made it difficult to estimate emissions from these sectors ( e. g. in biomass and kerosene combustion ) , which caused delays in completing their national GHG inventories . In the assessment of vulnerability and adaptation , Parties noted a lack of the data required as input to impact models and assessments . Therefore , vulnerability and adaptation assessments were based on broad sensitivity studies and the use of expert judgement , although some experts indicated that this method was not generally the preferred option for conducting such assessments . Many Parties also indicated that the assessment of potential mitigation options was constrained by the lack of relevant data and information . Where data were available they were not relevant for sector- and country-specific mitigation analysis . IPCC methodologies and other models Parties generally reported that many of the methodological problems and constraints they encountered in using the IPCC methodologies and other models were due to the fact that many of the default methodologies from the IPCC did not take into account their specific national circumstances . Many Parties also reported that the use of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines ( IPCC Guidelines ) for estimating the GHG emissions in some sectors was inappropriate to their circumstances , particularly in the land-use change and forestry sector ( LUCF ) where forest classifications and the terms used in the LUCF section of the IPCC Guidelines were not consistent with the classifications and definitions used in non-Annex I Parties . For example , growth rates of biomass and/or emission rates used in the IPCC Guidelines for soil carbon , and estimation of fractions of biomass burnt on site , burnt off site or left to decay , were not appropriate for use in many non-Annex I Parties . Many Parties also had difficulties in matching the classification systems recommended by the IPCC Guidelines for animals and agricultural soils to their own circumstances . This created problems in the choice and use of default emission factors , thereby affecting the reliability of the results in the agriculture sector . Similar problems were experienced in calculating the emissions from waste disposal . Many difficulties were encountered in applying and using the IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation ( IPCC Technical Guidelines ) in completing vulnerability and adaptation assessments . These difficulties mainly stem from the unsuitability of existing methods and tools , lack of national capacity/expertise to develop and/or use socio-economic scenarios , and lack of financial resources for assessment work . The analytical methods provided by the IPCC Technical Guidelines and the internationally developed integrated assessment methods , and policy development and decision support tools were often found to be incompatible with local needs and capacities . Integrated assessments and other such sophisticated diagnostic assessments typically required levels of information and expertise that were not widely and readily available in many non-Annex I Parties . This led Parties to use qualitative studies , which were compatible with local capacities , but could be less credible . Many Parties found that difficulties in undertaking impact assessments were mainly due to unavailability of models and inability to apply them . For example , some countries had difficulties in selecting and testing a general circulation model that would adequately fit their own circumstances . The use of MAGICC/SCENGEN was generally reported as being unsatisfactory due to its inappropriate downscaling methods and output . Other Parties indicated that they did not have sufficient knowledge or expertise to use/apply impact models for vulnerability and adaptation assessment . Most of the Parties identified adaptation to climate change as a major issue and included a list of potential adaptation options in their national communications . However , many of these Parties did not evaluate , prioritize and cost these adaptation options . This could be attributed to the fact that the IPCC Technical Guidelines did not adequately address the identification and evaluation of specific adaptation strategies , and to the lack of national expertise to undertake cost-benefit analysis on adaptation options . In general , the identified GHG mitigation options were not assessed comprehensively , due to the lack of common analytical tools ( e. g. models ) and of specific studies , and expertise . Additionally , the lack of models/software for scenario construction , particularly in the agriculture and livestock sectors , presented a serious constraint in conducting mitigation assessments . For some Parties , the preparation of technical studies was constrained by the fact that many of the methodologies and other models , and their instructions and other related documentation , were available only in English , so it was difficult for some experts to use and apply these methods and models . Institutional arrangements , information and networking A major constraint for many Parties was the lack of appropriate institutional arrangements and of clarity over roles and responsibilities of experts and institutions in carrying out the technical studies relating to the preparation of the national communication , which affected data collection and information exchange and networking among countries , regions and project personnel . Some Parties reported that their activities were constrained by the lack of effective coordination among the different ministries involved , and limited awareness among policy makers . The national climate change committees charged with the preparation of national communications in many countries were neither active , nor operational , and many were not granted the necessary legal and institutional authority to effectively carry out their work ; they were therefore not sufficiently motivated to implement their tasks in a timely manner . They also lacked the necessary human capacity to ensure a minimum level of active participation in and monitoring of technical studies , review and endorsement of the project outputs and launching of concrete follow-up actions relating to the preparation of national communications . In some Parties , project implementation was delayed by high turnover of technical staff , political instability and/or a change in project leadership within the institutions responsible for the preparation of the national communication . Some Parties found that weak institutional arrangements and the lack of human resources and capacities for conducting systematic data collection , together with the absence of universities and/or research centres working on climate change issues , particularly in small and poor countries , made it difficult to implement the activities relating to the preparation of national communications . Many Parties recognized that the use of information systems forms an important part of GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment and mitigation analysis , and that networking helps to provide access to updated information and promote the exchange of experiences on these issues . However , many Parties found that such exchange of information and networking were generally weak due to limited human and financial resources , limited data and information , and underdeveloped systems for collecting , processing and maintaining data and information . The lack of hardware , software and expertise for establishing and maintaining networking facilities for the exchange of information ( computers , communication channels ) , presented major constraints in this regard . Many Parties stressed that the low priority granted to vulnerability and adaptation issues by policy makers at the highest levels of government has affected cooperation and coordination among stakeholders in conducting the vulnerability and adaptation assessments . Research and systematic observation , education , training and public awareness Almost all Parties highlighted their limited capacities to undertake research and systematic observation activities such as accessing , analysing and managing data relevant to climate change in the areas of impact assessment , detection and early warning of climate extreme events and climate prediction . These limitations were mainly due to lack of financial resources and of human capacities and capabilities , as well as to limited technical support . Many Parties indicated that the level of scientific research and scholarship in institutions which have been established to conduct research was low and/or deteriorating . Some Parties further noted that the problem of lack of research activities was further compounded by irregular observations , out-dated and/or deteriorating infrastructure/systems for data collection , and the inability to access , process and transfer observational data . Many Parties emphasized that the issue of climate change was new to them and so their effort in climate change education , training and public awareness was not commensurate with the importance they placed on this issue . Some Parties also indicated that unavailability of experts and limited financial resources caused difficulties in organizing training workshops for their technical teams , which contributed to the considerable delays in the preparation of different technical studies ( inventory , mitigation , vulnerability ) . The integration of climate change issues into educational curricula was recognized as crucial for the future , but many Parties did not have appropriate resources for such integration . There was also a lack of clear and targeted awareness and education programmes , and the training provided was limited in scope . Many Parties emphasized that awareness and education on climate change issues among the public at large and the policy makers was minimal , partly because of the limited coverage of climate change issues by local media , the lack of active participation on this issue by non-governmental organizations in that area , and limited technical advice and support material . In this context , several Parties mentioned the lack of sufficiently trained scientific and technical personnel , policy makers , and the institutions to carry out research and training on climate change issues . Resources : human , technical and financial Globally the resources dedicated to vulnerability and adaptation studies were not commensurate with the needs and the importance that Parties place on these issues . Limited financial resources , insufficient and inappropriate tools , limited sectoral coverage , insufficient capacity and expertise , lack of experience to coordinate , implement and participate in climate change activities efficiently at the national , subregional , regional and international levels , were all highlighted . Many Parties considered that the level of funding provided and the period allowed for the preparation of the initial national communication were not sufficient to enable them to provide adequate and reliable information in the initial national communication . Some Parties noted that their governments had limited resources to address climate change issues and pointed out that these limitations were not very well compensated by external support for climate change activities . They further indicated that this may be because some bilateral programmes focus on the countries that have a large GHG mitigation potential . Other Parties stressed that their low economic situation meant that climate change issues were given low priority . Insufficient funds for international consultants and for project team members presented many problems in the implementation of the activities relating to the preparation of the national communications . This was particularly true in engaging and involving experts in training , international meetings and workshops . Some Parties stressed that funding available to conduct impact and vulnerability analyses in many sectors that are of vital importance to the national economy was inadequate . Many Parties indicated that in order to address climate change issues in a multidisciplinary and an efficient way , they would require additional financial and technical resources to develop and train a critical mass of human resources . Specific technical problems and constraints that have affected non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete their initial national communications Many of the problems and constraints faced by those Parties who have not yet submitted their initial national communications were similar to those faced by non-Annex I Parties that had already completed their initial national communications . However , Parties that have yet to complete their initial national communications face other specific technical problems and constraints . Some Parties stressed that the implementation of the activities and tasks relating to the preparation of national communications was often hampered by the lack of , or insufficient , level of coordination , especially among the technical experts responsible for such tasks , which often led to lengthy delays in starting and completing technical studies relevant for the preparation of national communications . Many Parties found that bureaucratic inertia/bottlenecks inherent within national institutions responsible for the preparation of national communication , and weak institutional linkages between the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) Country Offices and the national executing agencies , with resulting lack of clarity over their respective roles and responsibilities , often slowed progress in implementing the activities and tasks relating to the preparation of national communications . Some Parties also had difficulties in applying the UNDP modalities for the nationally executed programmes , which were not necessarily consistent with the enabling activities project management procedures . This also led to further delays in the implementation of the projects relating to the preparation of national communications . Some Parties specifically attributed the delays in the preparation of initial national communications to social disturbances and/or political problems and the resultant changes in the leadership of the projects . Such changes sometimes led to inactivity relating to the preparation of national communications , where either the expertise was not available or the institutional arrangements were not appropriate . Other Parties indicated that it was not always clear which agency would be responsible for preparing the initial national communication , thereby leading to lengthy delays . In its previous report to the subsidiary bodies ( FCCC/SBI/2001/15 ) , the CGE noted that a number of multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes had provided human , technical and financial assistance to 137 of a total of 146 non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their initial national communications . The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) was the largest contributor ( US$ 79.6 million ) , through its climate change enabling activities programmes . This , however , represented only about seven per cent of the total funds ( US$ 1.052 billion ) allocated by the GEF to the climate change focal area for the period 1991 to July 2000. The majority of non-Annex I Parties ( 124 ) had received support from the GEF climate change enabling activities programmes , and only three Parties that had submitted their initial national communication ( Israel , the Republic of Korea and Singapore ) did not receive any support from any of the support programmes . The GEF , in collaboration with the UNDP , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and the UNFCCC , established and funded the National Communications Support Programme , which provided human and technical support to 130 non-Annex I Parties , including countries in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States . Technical support and assistance provided was mainly in the form of thematic subregional exchange workshops , technical reviews , a help desk and networking . Funding for this support programme comprised US$ 2.1 million from the GEF and US$ 1.3 million through cofinancing from Denmark , the European Community , Finland and Norway . Support from the bilateral support programmes and Annex II Parties was provided through their respective programmes : the United States Country Studies Programme ( USCSP ) , the German Technical Cooperation Agency ( GTZ ) , the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme ( NCCSAP ) , the Finland Climate Change Assistance Programme , and the governments of New Zealand and Greece . Other Annex II Parties ( Australia , Denmark , Japan , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom ) had also provided financial resources and technical assistance to non-Annex I Parties through climate change training courses , workshops , studies and projects/programmes . Level of funding As of 30 June 2002 , the GEF has provided US$ 1.5 billion in grants for climate change projects since its establishment as a pilot programme in 1991. About US$ 87.6 million , representing about six per cent of the total amount , was provided by the GEF to 133 non-Annex I Parties through its climate change enabling activities programmes for the preparation of initial national communications . The analysis of the support provided by multilateral and bilateral support programmes points to a growing need to increase capacity and enhance the work relating to the preparation of the national communications in the areas of national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and GHG mitigation analysis . In considering the availability of financial resources and technical support , the CGE found that many needs relating to financial and technical support still exist , and new needs have been identified by Parties . These needs will require additional financial and technical support to improve the preparation of national communications . Additional financial support would be needed for data collection , accessing , archiving , quality control , retrieval and management , as well as for capacity-building , and promotion of education , training and public awareness . The analysis of the distribution of financial resources , however , indicated that some countries had received three or four times more funding than had many other countries . The differing focus of the support activities and of the coverage across technical areas , countries and regions , as well as the lack of a reporting framework for the support programmes , particularly bilateral ones , made it difficult to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of these efforts to date . However , from the information presented above on the funding and activities of the support programmes , and information contained in document FCCC/SBI/2001/15 on this issue , it appeared that the level of funding and the number and scope of activities were not commensurate with the needs of Parties identified in their initial national communications and the needs of those Parties that have yet to complete the preparation of their initial national communications . Coordination An analysis of the implementation of activities of the support programmes indicated that there was a need for better coordination and interaction between these programmes , in order to enhance the overall effectiveness of their use of limited resources and to ensure that smaller and poorer countries received adequate attention . This could be done through the establishment of an information sharing mechanism , developed and hosted by a relevant agency/institution , such as the UNFCCC secretariat , to provide information on assistance programmes that support the preparation of national communication or any of its elements . The CGE noted the important role of the National Communication Support Programme in assisting non-Annex I Parties during the preparation of their initial national communications . The CGE was of the view that the newly established National Communications Support Unit of the UNDP might be well placed to assist countries , particularly those that have recently started to prepare their initial national communications . Additionally , the CGE emphasized that there was a need to develop and strengthen interactions and links within and between countries and regions , through multi-country , regional and global projects , and through regional centres of excellence working on various climate change issues , where appropriate . Lessons learned The experiences gained and lessons learned by the multilateral and bilateral support programmes in providing human , financial and technical support for project implementation point to a number of areas where changes could improve the institutional arrangements necessary for the preparation of national communications : Greater involvement of and participation by key policy stakeholders from the beginning of the project cycle and/or at the project concept level and heightened country-driven discussions on the projects and acitvities ; Political support and buy-in to the project and the enhancement of appropriate institutional frameworks for the preparation of national communication ; Engagement of in-country personnel in project activities and promotion of country ownership of the project ; Provision of financial and technical support and integration of project activities and outputs with national policies and strategies ; Building and maintaining capacity of national and/or regional expertise to collect , process and analyse data for enhancing the preparation of national communications and planning for sustainable development ; Focusing studies undertaken in the context of the preparation of national communications , on national priorities . Future plans The multilateral and bilateral support programmes also indicated their plans to continue their activities and programmes to facilitate and support non-Annex I Parties in the implementation of the Convention , including the preparation of national communications . These programmes include the UNEP/IPCC project on the Assessment of Impacts of and Adaptation to Climate Change in multiple regions or sectors , and the World Bank project on Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in the Caribbean region . The UNDP 's National Communication Support Unit will implement three regional pilot projects to build capacity in 34 countries on improving the quality of national GHG inventories through the use of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management and to prepare for stage II adaptation using the UNDP 's Adaptation Policy Framework . Additionally , a global project on systematic observation is underway , in conjunction with the Global Climate Observing System secretariat . All these activities will feed into the national communication process . The bilateral programmes include phase II of the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme , support by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation to the National Communications Support Unit of the UNDP , and the activities of the Danish Agency for Development Assistance . The United States Agency for International Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have plans to continue to provide human , technical and financial support to non-Annex I Parties for activities that underpin the preparation of national communications , including national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and mitigation analysis . To overcome some of the technical problems and constraints identified by non-Annex I Parties in their initial national communications , and by the CGE in fulfilling its mandate in pursuance of decisions 8/CP.5 and 31/CP.7 , several recommendations were made by the CGE to improve the process of the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Data and information Additional resources should be mobilized to develop and implement a sustainable data collection , compilation , archiving and updating management system for national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis . Regional cooperation in activity data generation and management should be encouraged . Particular groups of nations and or regions should develop emission factors , particularly for key sources , to better reflect their national circumstances . Information relating to technical material , methods , tools and models for national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and GHG mitigation analysis needs to be made available in all official languages of the United Nations at the earliest opportunity and in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of Parties . IPCC methodologies and other models Existing methodologies for GHG inventories should be improved and made clearer for use in non-Annex I Parties . In particular , more clarification is needed in the use of terms and the forest classification systems in the land-use change and forestry sector . The IPCC should be encouraged to develop methods , tools and other models for use in assessing impacts and adaptations in agriculture , water resources , coastal zones and human health at time scales that are relevant for policy-making processes in non-Annex I Parties . Methodologies and models for assessing mitigation options and analysing abatement potential should be made readily accessible to non-Annex I Parties . Studies to conduct detailed cost-benefit analysis should be encouraged in non-Annex I Parties . Institutional arrangements , information and networking Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged , with international support , to develop appropriate and sustainable institutional frameworks and arrangements to carry out activities relating to the preparation of national communications and the implementation of the Convention on a continuous basis . Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged to streamline and mainstream activities relating to national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis in their recurrent programmes of work . The GEF and its implementing agencies should be encouraged to clarify roles and responsibilities in close consultation with the national executing agencies relating to the preparation of national communications . Information exchange and sharing of experiences on the preparation of the national communications should be encouraged within and between countries and regions . Regional research and educational centres should be strengthened and , where appropriate , established in various regions . Research and systematic observation , education , training and public awareness Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged to undertake assessment of their capacity and needs for research and systematic observation and for climate change education , training and public awareness . Training of national experts on climate change issues such as national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis should be carried out continuously . The scope of training on climate change issues should be widened , to include data and uncertainty analysis and vulnerability and adaptation assessments , at both basic and advanced levels . Resources : human , technical and financial Additional human , technical and financial resources should be provided to non-Annex I Parties for the improvement of the process of preparation of national communications . Additional financial resources should be made available to non-Annex I Parties to enhance national expertise to systematically collect , analyse and maintain appropriate data and databases for the preparation of national communications . Clear additional guidance should be given to the GEF to provide financial resources that are commensurate with the resource needs identified by non-Annex I Parties in their national communications . Existing methodologies and national capacities to undertake integrated assessment of climate change impacts in different sectors , such as water resources , agriculture and human health , coastal zones , human settlements and biodiversity , should be enhanced . Training on the use of software and technical guidelines should be provided to non-Annex I Parties so that the studies can be carried out locally . Financial and technical assistance should be provided for assessment of vulnerability and the economic and social costs of adaptation measures . UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications In fulfilling its mandate contained in decision 8/CP.5 , the CGE considered the information presented in the initial national communications in accordance with the UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties ( annex to decision 10/CP.2 ) , with a view to improving them . The CGE report containing recommendations for improving the guidelines for reporting on national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , GHG mitigation analysis and education , training and public awareness in the national communication , was submitted to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth session , and is contained in document FCCC/SBI/2001/15 . In pursuance of decision 31/CP.7 , the CGE also provided its input to the proposed improved UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention . The input of the CGE on the proposed improved guidelines is contained in document FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.8 . Annex Report of the Chair of the Consultative Group of Experts A report on the work of the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention ( CGE ) was presented to the sixteenth sessions of the subsidiary bodies by the Chair of that group , Ms. Isabelle Niang-Diop ( Senegal ) . In her report , the Chair of the CGE recalled that the CGE had presented its first report ( FCCC/SBI/2001/15 ) , covering the period 2000-2001 , to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth sessions in October 2001 in Marrakesh , Morocco . In addition to the mandate contained in the annex to decision 8/CP.5 , the Chair of the CGE reminded delegates of the mandate given by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh session ( decision 31/CP.7 ) , requesting the CGE : ( i ) to identify and assess technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies ; ( ii ) to provide input to the draft improved guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties ; ( iii ) to conduct two workshops with the objective of sharing experiences ; and ( iv ) to organize , to the extent possible , a meeting back-to-back with a meeting of the least developed countries expert group ( LEG ) . The Chair subsequently gave an overview of the activities undertaken by the CGE since its last report . This included a summary of the workshop held in April 2002 on the identification and assessment of technical problems and constraints faced by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to submit their initial national communications , as well as the outcomes of the fifth CGE meeting which addressed the issue of coordination of activities and programmes that facilitate and support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties , the work plan to fulfil its current mandate , the relationship between the CGE and the LEG and the exchange of views on potential activities for future improvement of the preparation of national communications . The Chair noted that the CGE , in implementing the mandate contained in decision 31/CP.7 , had held its first workshop from 10 to 12 April 2002 in Bonn , Germany . The workshop had facilitated the exchange of experiences with non-Annex I Parties on different issues related to the preparation of national communications . It had also provided the initial input by the CGE into the draft improved guidelines which was presented to the intersessional workshop on the revision of the guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties , held from 15 to 17 April 2002 in Bonn , Germany . The CGE had analysed views provided by some non-Annex I Parties ( not including least developed countries ) that had received funds more than three years ago for the preparation of their initial national communications and had not submitted them . Views on the technical problems and constraints Parties are facing had been provided by means of a questionnaire and presentations at the workshop . The CGE noted that those Parties faced methodological and analytical problems similar to those of Parties that had submitted their initial national communications . However , the presentations in the workshops had revealed additional institutional , management and resource constraints , as reported in document FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.3 . According to the Chair , the CGE recognized the difficulties with the coordination of existing activities and programmes that facilitate and support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . The CGE had thus recommended that exchange of information on existing activities and programmes be improved , for example by establishing a publicly accessible database on past and ongoing activities and programmes relating to the preparation of national communications . The CGE had also recognized with concern that important programmes that supported the preparation of national communications were no longer in place , without any consideration for their replacement . The Chair indicated that the CGE had stressed that there was a need for continuing the financial and technical assistance for the 62 non-Annex I Parties that were still in the process of preparing their initial national communications . Regarding the CGE work plan for the period between June and October 2002 , the Chair stated that the CGE had held discussions on its report to the seventeenth session of the subsidiary bodies and on a tentative programme for its second workshop . From these discussions , the CGE had agreed on the following : The report of the CGE to the seventeenth session of the subsidiary bodies would consist of a synthesis of the work accomplished by the CGE from its establishment at COP 5 up to COP 8 in October 2002. It would also present the results of exchange of views on potential activities for future improvement of the preparation of national communications ; The CGE had decided to hold its second workshop from 7 to 9 August , possibly in Nassau , Bahamas , with the aim of completing its work on problems and constraints of non-Annex I Parties that had yet to submit their initial national communications , and on support programmes and activities . Countries that had not yet presented information on the technical problems and constraints that they were facing in the preparation of their initial national communications would be invited to do so at this workshop . Representatives of multilateral agencies that support the preparation of national communications would be invited to make presentations on their programmes in accordance with a framework that should be provided by the CGE . Presentations would also be made by experts on how to overcome some of the constraints that had been identified already . The Chair reported that the CGE had also discussed its relationship with the least developed countries expert group ( LEG ) . The group had noted that a back-to-back meeting would unfortunately not be feasible for 2002 as originally decided at COP 7 ( decision 31/CP.7 , paragraph 5 ) . The CGE , however , had stressed the importance of exchanging views between the two groups through the two common members , the consideration of each group 's reports and the participation of experts from the LEG at the CGE workshops . The CGE had also discussed the provision of financial resources for the preparation of the second national communications . In the light of the gaps and constraints identified in the preparation of the initial national communications , the CGE recognized that it might be necessary to increase the financial resources to improve the process of the preparation of national communications . The CGE recommended that the distribution by the GEF of financial resources among Parties for the preparation of national communications should be based on transparent criteria , considering the specific needs of each Party . Furthermore , the CGE had exchanged views on possible future activities to improve the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties and in this regard had identified as potential areas : a technical assessment of national communications on a voluntary basis ; organization of workshops on specific topics ; monitoring of capacity-building programmes and strengthening of coordination between the national communication processes ; and reporting activities under other environmental agreements . In line with this , it would be necessary to identify the appropriate institutional arrangements to support these activities . The Chair of the CGE stated that it was her belief that many of the technical issues , problems and constraints identified in the preparation of initial national communications , and recommendations made by the CGE , would form the basis upon which financial and technical support would be made available for the preparation of subsequent national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Therefore , the subsidiary bodies might wish to invite the financial mechanism and bilateral organizations to provide financial and technical resources to those non-Annex I Parties that were ready to start the preparation of their second national communications . In concluding , the Chair acknowledged the dedication and commitment provided by the CGE experts , and their respective governments and organizations who had supported their participation in the CGE . She also extended this acknowledgement to the other experts ( 101 participants representing 68 Parties ) that had participated in the CGE workshops . It was to these that the Chair , on behalf of the CGE , expressed her gratitude and thanks . The Chair also thanked the Governments of Australia , Finland , Germany ( through the Bonn Fund ) , Switzerland , the Netherlands and the United States of America for funding the CGE workshops and the UNFCCC secretariat for the excellent support it had provided to the CGE in the organization of its work and the production of its reports . * This document is submitted after the due date because all the necessary information was not available on time . Three regional workshops , one each for the regions of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean , were held in 2000 ; one interregional workshop was held in 2001 ; and two interregional workshops were held in 2002. Support programmes are those activities , projects and programmes which supported the preparation of initial national communications , and the preparation of various elements of the national communication ( e. g. national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment , mitigation assessment ) . The climate change enabling activities programmes include activities that are funded through expedited procedures , full projects that use standard procedures of funding , and projects covering limited components of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties .
