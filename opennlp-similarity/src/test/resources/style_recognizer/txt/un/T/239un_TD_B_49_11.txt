Forty-ninth session Geneva , 7-18 October 2002 Item 2 of the provisional agenda HOW CAN THE POST-DOHA PROCESS WORK BEST FOR DEVELOPMENT ? Background note by the UNCTAD secretariat Executive summary This background note raises a number of questions that might usefully be considered in relation to the treatment of development-related concerns in the post-Doha work programme of the World Trade Organization . Apart from broader issues such as the ongoing concerns of developing countries about implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round and special and differential treatment for developing countries , the note touches on selected issues from a number of areas of work covered by the WTO Ministerial Declaration , examing these from a development perspective . The note should be read in conjunction with the document “ Developments and Issues in the Post-Doha Work Programme of Particular Concern to Developing Countries ” ( TD/B/49/12 ) , which contains additional considerations regarding the content and overall context of the post-Doha process . Introduction Development issues have been at the forefront of debate in the World Trade Organization for the last several years . The need to address these concerns was recognized at the WTO Fourth Ministerial Meeting in Doha in November 2001 , leading to a Ministerial Declaration and other decisions by Ministers that constitute a work programme with important development components . In many respects the post-Doha work programme offers important opportunities to promote development - but is a development-friendly outcome guaranteed ? How successful will the Doha texts be in re-orienting the WTO system towards development ? How is special and differential treatment ( SDT ) being implemented in the current work programme ? Are there any indications of how SDT is to be implemented in the outcome of the negotiations ? What progress has been made towards giving SDT a more secure legal base ? How can SDT provisions be reconciled with the concept of a “ Single Undertaking ” ? The Doha Declaration contains frequent references to technical assistance for developing countries , and technical cooperation and capacity-building are confirmed as “ core elements of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system ” . Are there sufficient resources to execute all the technical cooperation activities envisaged in the post-Doha work programme ? What role can other agencies , in particular UNCTAD , play in providing technical cooperation and capacity-building to developing countries in the current negotiations ? What is the appropriate balance between such support for developing countries in WTO negotiations , as well as other trade policy development and administration ( including within the context of the Integrated Framework ) and support for negotiations and building supply capacity in developing countries ? In a number of areas , such as investment , competition policy , government procurement and trade facilitation , provision is made for negotiations to take place after the Fifth Session of the Ministerial Conference on the basis of a decision to be taken , by explicit consensus , at that session on modalities of negotiations . What exactly does explicit consensus mean ? What progress is being made on such issues ? A number of areas , such as electronic commerce , trade , debt and finance , and trade and the transfer of technology are also an integral part of the post-Doha work programme ; work in these areas is important for ensuring an effective link between trade and development . A report is to be made to the Fifth Ministerial Session on the desirability of possible negotiations on certain aspects of trade and environment ( while other aspects are already subject to negotiation ) . What progress has been made in these areas ? Overall , what progress is being made in the WTO 's post-Doha work programme from a development perspective ? What needs to be achieved before the Fifth Ministerial Session from a development perspective ? Implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round How are developing countries ' concerns about implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round being met - for example , in relation to transition periods and technical assistance ? Can the liberalization targets - for example , for textiles and clothing - be met on schedule without being negated by alternative protectionist measures ? How are “ best endeavours ” clauses to take account of developing-country interests being implemented ? The post-Doha work programme holds out hope for gains by developing countries , but it may also be expected to lead to further commitments . What are the perceived gains , and how do they compare with the expected costs of implementation ? Is it reasonable or feasible to ask developing countries to take on new commitments at this stage ? Are developing countries capable of fully meeting the commitments from the Uruguay Round and at the same time starting a new trade negotiations round ? What can be done to strengthen their capacity ? Selected Issues covered by the Doha MInisterial Declaration Agriculture The Doha document provides that trade and non-trade concerns should be taken into account in the agriculture negotiations . Special and differential treatment ( SDT ) for developing countries is to be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations . How are conflicting objectives to be reconciled ? What are the prospects for a “ development box ” ? How can the interests of developing net food-exporters countries and net food-importing countries be made compatible ? Industrial products Negotiations on market access for industrial goods are aimed at reducing or eliminating tariff peaks , tariff escalation and non-tariff measures affecting all products , and in particular products of interest to developing countries . What should be the targets ( average cuts ) and modalities ( e. g. formulas or request and offer ) ? What transition periods should be allowed ? To what extent might developing countries have to make concessions that could limit their scope for industrial development programmes ? How can the Doha mandate on less than full reciprocity by developing countries in non-agricultural negotiations be given effect , as established in GATT Article XXVIII bis ? How can concerns about the erosion of preferences be addressed , and what kinds of development-oriented measures could be envisaged to compensate for that erosion ? How are non-tariff measures , including rules of origin , being handled ? Services In the GATS , how can Article IV on increasing participation by developing countries be operationalized ? What is being done to overcome obstacles to the liberalization of sectors or modes of supply of particular export interest to developing countries ? How can the negotiations ensure that national objectives for essential services are met ? How can it be ensured that disciplines on domestic regulation will not compromise developing countries ' flexibility to establish an appropriate regulatory framework ? What disciplines on subsidies would limit trade-distorting subsidies while providing for flexibility in relation to the development programmes of developing countries ? How can credit be granted for autonomous liberalization ? Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) The Doha Ministerial Declaration stresses the importance of protecting intellectual property rights while promoting access to existing medicines . How is it possible to provide incentives for research and , at the same time , give developing countries and least developed countries ( LDCs ) access to essential medicines ? The Doha Decisions reaffirmed that the provisions of Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement are mandatory . What measures can promote the transfer of technology to developing countries ? Trade and environment At the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg , the importance of achieving a sustainable model of development was emphasized . Consequently , linkages between trade and environment are expected to become more important . Will the outcome of the Johannesburg meeting affect the balance between environmental protection and the need to provide developing countries flexibility in achieving their development objectives ? How can synergies be promoted between environmental protection , economic development and trade ? Trade and investment In paragraph 20 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration , the importance of ensuring secure and predictable conditions for investment is underlined . However , paragraph 22 recognizes the importance of reflecting in a balanced manner the interests of home and host countries , paying attention to development policies and objectives as well as the countries ' right to regulate in the public interest . How can these two objectives be balanced ? In order to facilitate the use of legal investment measures and to provide guidelines for the use of measures for national development purposes , how can developing countries ensure that FDI promotion can be achieved while not causing disturbance to trade ? Trade and competition policy The following questions have been discussed in relation to trade and competition policy : What could a multilateral framework on competition ( MFC ) achieve that could not be achieved through a domestic competition law complemented as appropriate and feasible by bilateral or regional agreements as well as by a non-binding instrument such as the Set ? Is a MFC feasible , given the great disparities in countries ' market structures , economic development , institutional capacities and experiences in this area ? How could the development dimension best be catered to within a MFC ? What would be the relationship between a WTO-based MFC and other multilateral rules in this area , including existing WTO-based rules ) ? How would compliance with an MFC be verified or enforced ? Least-developed countries The Ministerial Declaration recognized “ that the integration of the LDCs into the multilateral trading system requires meaningful market access , support for the diversification of their production and export base , and trade-related technical assistance and capacity building ” . What has been done , and what can be done in the context of the post-Doha work programme in respect of these three priority areas ? Furthermore , how can negotiations with acceding LDCs be facilitated and accelerated ? Small economies How can the integration of small economies into international trade be promoted , taking into account the associated trade difficulties and investment difficulties ?
