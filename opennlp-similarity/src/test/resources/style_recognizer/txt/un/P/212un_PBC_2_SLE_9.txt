Peacebuilding Commission Second session Sierra Leone configuration Progress report on the implementation of the Sierra Leone Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework Contents Introduction The Peacebuilding Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone adopted the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework ( PBC/2/SLE/1 ) on 12 December 2007. Six months later , the Framework is widely recognized as one of the principal engagement and partnership tools between the Government of Sierra Leone and the international community . As part of the follow-up to the implementation of the commitments contained in the Framework , and in recognition that the Framework is a “ living document ” , the Government and the Peacebuilding Commission have developed the present progress report . The report takes stock of the progress made and challenges encountered by all stakeholders in the implementation of the Framework and contains recommendations on the required next steps . Trend analysis and risk assessment of peacebuilding Youth employment and empowerment Youth unemployment and marginalization continue to represent a threat to peace consolidation in Sierra Leone . The Government of Sierra Leone , with the support of its international partners , has made a strong commitment to address the situation of youth and has established various institutions , policies and programmes to do so . However , owing to the fragmentation of actors and the proliferation of small projects , such efforts have not generated the desired impact . As a result , the Government has announced plans to create a national youth commission to provide the necessary policy direction and leadership to the many agencies and departments of the Government and the international actors addressing issues of youth . The Government also plans to set up district-level labour centres to invest in the national workforce and to assist in job placement . There is now growing recognition among all partners that short-term efforts for employment must be complemented by long-term employment-generation strategies and overall economic growth through private sector development . In addition , youth empowerment efforts must closely involve youth organizations and contain targeted interventions to address the particular needs of young women and girls . Justice and security sector reform The security sector reform has been recognized as one of the major successes of post-conflict peacebuilding in Sierra Leone . The institutions of the sector are well established , with clear lines of authority and a functioning coordination structure . The performance of the security institutions in the 2007 national elections and in the preparatory process for the 2008 local council elections has demonstrated their growing capacity and credibility in the eyes of the local population and international observers . However , the sector continues to be heavily dependent on international support , undermining the sustainability of the reform initiatives . In addition , the security sector must play a more active role in facilitating economic growth , increasing revenue generation and supporting anti-corruption initiatives . For example , the sector could play a significant role in enhancing border security and border management , thus reducing the significant revenues currently lost through diamond and gold smuggling . Access to justice continues to be a challenge for the majority of Sierra Leoneans . In the context of the Justice Sector Development Programme , and with the support of the Peacebuilding Fund , concerted efforts are ongoing to improve the provision of justice services , to reduce the backlog of court cases , to address overcrowded conditions in prisons and to provide training to justice sector personnel . The Presidential task force constituted to identify the causes for the delays in justice delivery submitted its report in January 2008. The recommendations of the report have been incorporated in the recently approved Justice Sector Reform Strategy . C. Consolidation of democracy and good governance The successful conclusion of the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007 and the peaceful and democratic transfer of power in Sierra Leone are significant achievements in the consolidation of democracy and good governance . The new Government has embarked on a number of measures aimed at strengthening accountability and public sector performance . In particular , encouraging reforms are being implemented by the Anti-Corruption Commission . However , additional efforts are needed to strengthen local governance institutions , in particular by clarifying the relationship between the local councils and the traditional authorities . Greater efforts are also needed to foster national reconciliation and enhanced inter-party and intra-party dialogue . National institutions such as the Political Parties Registration Commission , the National Democracy Commission and the Parliament should play a greater role in such efforts . D. Capacity-building The limited capacity of the Government of Sierra Leone , as well as other national actors , represents a major obstacle to peacebuilding in Sierra Leone . The Government , has prioritized capacity development at all levels , especially in the areas of human resources development and civil service reform . The international community is also committed to ensuring that all of its activities in the country have a capacity-building component . The United Nations in particular specializes in capacity-building of national actors and institutions . However , there is still a lack of conceptual clarity on what constitutes effective capacity-building and how best to ensure the sustainability of reform efforts . E. Energy sector In the last few months , impressive developments have been observed in the energy sector . The sector was identified as an urgent priority of the new Government . Guided by the Government 's vision and prioritization , the partners of Sierra Leone have been able to contribute effectively to the implementation of the emergency energy plan for the Western Area . With these efforts under way , greater attention must be paid to the development of an overall energy sector strategy and coordination structures to bring together the various departments and agencies working on energy production , transmission and distribution . The Government of Sierra Leone projects that by the end of 2008 the energy situation will be out of the emergency phase . F. Subregional dimension of peacebuilding The leaders in the Mano River subregion are demonstrating a greater appreciation for the strong linkages between their countries and an increased commitment to a subregional approach to solving issues of peace , security and development . This is particularly encouraging given the region 's recent turbulent history . The Mano River subregion has been one of the most violent and politically unstable parts of the world . As recently as October 2004 , nearly half of the total number of United Nations peacekeepers deployed in the world was in the subregion . It is , however , also encouraging to note that some of the best outcomes of United Nations involvement in conflict situations have taken place in that subregion . By now it is well understood that conflict and instability in one country in the subregion will have significant impact on the others . Recent activities of the Mano River Union , notably the Heads of Government Summit , held in Monrovia on 14 and 15 May 2008 , have been encouraging , and must be further supported through capacity-building of the Mano River Union secretariat . Review of mutual commitments Commitments of the Government of Sierra Leone As noted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sierra Leone , “ Sierra Leone attaches great importance to the Framework and its speedy implementation as a deterrent to relapse into conflict . ” Over the last six months , the Government of Sierra Leone , with the support of the United Nations and other partners , has made significant progress in implementing several commitments contained in the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework . In particular , the Government has made significant progress in the areas of anti-corruption , good governance , planning for the local council elections , energy sector development and the justice and security sector reform . Concerted additional efforts are needed to meet the commitments on youth empowerment and employment and capacity-building . Annex I to the present report contains a detailed report on the implementation of the Government 's commitments and the necessary next steps . Consolidation of democracy and good governance In order to foster a common vision and create a culture of accountability and good governance , President Koroma launched an “ agenda for change ” at a retreat attended by all Government ministers and senior officials . The following focus areas were identified at the retreat : ( a ) energy and water supply ; ( b ) transportation : roads , air ; ( c ) youth unemployment ; ( d ) growth sectors : ( i ) agriculture ; ( ii ) mining ; ( iii ) fisheries and marine resources ; ( iv ) tourism ; ( e ) social services : ( i ) education ; ( ii ) health care ; ( iii ) affordable housing ; ( f ) capacity development : ( i ) public sector ; ( ii ) local government ; ( iii ) private sector ; ( iv ) justice system . As a result , a commitment was made to develop performance contracts for all ministers and senior officials . The President has instituted a “ zero tolerance policy for corruption ” and has launched an attitudinal change campaign , clearly signalling his resolve to seriously address the issues . The President has also made national reconciliation and unity a personal priority and has on several occasions invited members of the opposition to accompany him on official overseas travel . Consistent with the commitments contained in the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework , a revised National Anti-Corruption Strategy was approved by the Cabinet and forwarded for consideration by the Parliament . The revised strategy strengthens the independence of the Anti-Corruption Commission . The Government of Sierra Leone has also pledged to introduce a Public Members Bill in Parliament that will confer prosecutorial powers on the Commission to enable them to prosecute cases directly . The need to separate the Office of the Attorney-General from that of the Minister of Justice has also been acknowledged in the report of the Constitutional Review Commission . The Anti-Corruption Commission has undertaken promising internal reforms and has developed a strategic plan for 2008-2010 . Preparations for the local council elections are under way , with the required financial resources pledged or committed through the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) managed elections basket fund . The ward boundaries delimitation process has been completed and was adopted by the Parliament despite some concerns raised by the minority Sierra Leone People 's Party . The voter registration process and the nomination of candidates were also undertaken successfully . However , the Government of Sierra Leone is still reviewing electoral regulations , in particular , the regulation on vote counting and tallying . The Political Parties Registration Commission is active in ensuring that the political parties adhere to a code of conduct , thus contributing to a peaceful and orderly electoral process . Following the elections , it will be critical to ensure institutionalization of the National Electoral Commission and the Political Parties Registration Commission and the reform of the regulatory framework for the elections . Justice and security sector reform The Sierra Leone Justice Sector Reform and Investment Plan 2008-2010 was launched under the leadership of the President of Sierra Leone in February 2008. The strategy is costed , prioritized and well sequenced , providing a good model for the development of other sector-wide strategies , especially for youth employment and empowerment . In line with the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework , the justice sector strategy , developed with the support of the Department for International Development ( United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) , does not try to address all justice sector challenges , but rather focuses on specific initiatives that can be undertaken in a three-year time frame . The Justice Sector Coordination Office has been set up in the Ministry of Justice to facilitate the implementation of the strategy . However , the overall responsibility for its implementation rests with the Justice Leadership Group , composed of the Minister of Justice , the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Chief Justice . The strategy is costed at $30 million over three years , of which $4.5 million is currently unfunded . Resource allocation across the sector will be provided in the context of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and the normal budgeting process of the Government . Additional progress has also been made with the support of the Peacebuilding Fund , especially in addressing the backlog of cases and training of the legal executives . Furthermore , some positive steps have been made towards building the capacity of the prosecutorial system by supporting the training of over 100 police prosecutors and investigators ( a more detailed discussion of Peacebuilding Fund projects is provided in para . The Constitutional Review Commission has submitted its report for consideration by the Cabinet , to be followed by consideration by the Parliament . A Cabinet subcommittee has been constituted to study the report and advise the full Cabinet on the actions to be taken . The report contains 136 amendments to the 1991 Constitution , 15 of which require a national referendum for approval . The United Nations and other actors remain engaged with the Government of Sierra Leone to ensure that the final document addresses the key recommendations and is consistent with the Lomé Peace Accord and the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , and takes a modern , development-oriented approach to the organization of the State administration at all levels . Consistent with its commitment in the Framework , the Government of Sierra Leone has announced its intention to reduce the size of the national armed forces to 8,500 from the current strength of 10,500 . This reduction proposal comes after a comprehensive core review undertaken by the Government with the support of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . The downsizing process will need to be carefully monitored to ensure reintegration of former soldiers into civilian life and the job market . A company of soldiers is currently being trained to participate in the standby force of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) . The National Human Rights Commission is now fully operational , with 28 staff . The Commission is currently working on a comprehensive report on the state of human rights in Sierra Leone , consistent with its statutory mandate . Importantly , the mandate for the Commission also includes follow-up on the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . The Government of Sierra Leone has made a commitment to assume the operational costs of the Commission , including the salary of core staff , after the completion of the ongoing Peacebuilding Fund support . Meanwhile , the Government continues to provide , albeit in minimal amounts , support to cover some operational costs . The Government , in collaboration with the United Nations , has put in place a mechanism to report on human rights activities in Sierra Leone . These activities will be jointly coordinated with the help of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the National Human Rights Commission . Gender-based violence , limited participation in decision-making and endemic poverty are critical challenges to gender equality and the empowerment of women in Sierra Leone . Inclusion of women and youth in the governance of the country , improved local revenue generation and sustainability of the State remain critical to peace consolidation . Youth employment and empowerment In the last few months , the Government of Sierra Leone , with the support of its partners , has undertaken efforts to revitalize the Youth Employment Scheme , the National Steering Committee on Youth Employment and Empowerment and the Youth Basket Fund , managed by UNDP . The Youth Employment Scheme and the activities of the Steering Committee and the Basket Fund experienced significant difficulties in 2007. In order to address those challenges , in early 2008 , the Department for International Development was requested to conduct an institutional review of the scheme and make recommendations to strengthen it . The results of the review were shared at a workshop on 10 April 2008 which brought together representatives from the donor community , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and a number of Government of Sierra Leone line ministries . The review identified two main weaknesses in the Youth Employment Scheme strategy : ( a ) its focus on the creation of short-term employment interventions which have created little long-term positive impact on the prospects of youth in the labour market ; ( b ) its lack of connection or coordination with the private sector development activities and ( c ) relatively little engagement of the Scheme with the business community . The overall recommendation of the review was for the Scheme to shift its primary focus away from short-term supply-side and socially designed interventions to focus on medium to longer-term demand-driven activities which are appropriately linked to labour market needs and targeted towards future growth sectors in the economy . Coordination on issues of youth employment and empowerment among the ministries , donors and United Nations agencies has also been a serious challenge in the past year . Recently , efforts have been made to empower the National Steering Committee and make it into an effective forum for discussion of youth issues . The Ministry of Youth , Sports and Education hosted an inaugural Steering Committee meeting on 24 January 2008 at which the Government of Sierra Leone reconfirmed its commitment to youth employment , requested assistance from the donors and promised its support to speed up the implementation of activities . On 8 May 2008 , at a Steering Committee meeting , the disbursement of $600,000 to microfinance institutions from the Peacebuilding Fund was approved . The funds are being used to increase the access of vulnerable youth to microcredit . On 5 June , at the Steering Committee meeting , the operational framework of the Youth Employment Scheme and the development of short-term and long-term strategies were discussed . Capacity-building The Government of Sierra Leone and its international partners need to agree on a comprehensive civil service reform package . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has recently undergone a personnel review in order to create a professional diplomatic and career service . The President has also set up a Public Service Reform Committee to look into reforming the civil service , especially in the areas of policy formulation and implementation capacity . The Government has stressed that without a serious purpose-oriented public service with a strategic focus , it will be impossible for the political machinery to succeed . As a result , the Government has put a premium on capacity-building efforts at all levels . It is hoped that this strategy will enable the public sector to become one of the drivers of Sierra Leone 's progress . Energy sector Since the adoption of the Framework in December 2007 , there has been remarkable improvement in the energy sector . In the Western Area , power generation has increased from 5 megawatts to 15 megawatts , representing an increase of about 300 per cent . The Government of Sierra Leone has also secured funding for the completion of the Bambuna hydroelectric power station by the end of 2008. However , additional resources are still needed to rehabilitate the transmission and distribution networks . In May 2008 , the Government convened a meeting of all relevant actors in the energy sector . Such coordination meetings must continue , resulting in the development of a well-costed and sequenced energy sector strategy . Subregional dimension of peacebuilding At the 18th session of the Mano River Union Summit , held in Monrovia on 14 and 15 May 2008 , Côte d'Ivoire formally joined the Union . The Summit also considered issues of common interest and concern relating to the revitalization of the Mano River Union secretariat , the consolidation of peace , security and stability , and the challenges posed by the global food crisis . In particular , the leaders agreed that the Mano River Union secretariat should take on critical peace and security matters within the subregion , including the control of small arms and light weapons , and harmonization of legislation on arms control . To address the growing food crisis , the leaders decided , inter alia , to promote subregional cooperation in managing the agricultural chain of input supply , production and marketing , as well as to focus on common geographical areas of high vulnerability and risk within the subregion . The Government of Sierra Leone is also looking at the ECOWAS military strategy for rapid deployment capacity to be set up in Sierra Leone . Commitments of the Peacebuilding Commission In the last few months , the Peacebuilding Commission has made significant strides towards fulfilling its commitments within the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework . Individually and collectively , Peacebuilding Commission members have supported the Government of Sierra Leone by raising international awareness , mobilizing resources and providing technical support consistent with the priority areas of the Framework . Twenty-one country-specific meeting members are active in Sierra Leone either bilaterally or through multilateral channels . Through their engagement , notable support has already been provided in the priority areas of good governance , justice and security sector reform , and energy sector development . Several country-specific meeting members , such as Japan , Norway and Sweden have also recently increased their support for the country . However , additional and more targeted efforts are needed to support the implementation of commitments related to youth empowerment , regional cooperation and capacity-building . Annex II to the present report summarizes progress made under each of the commitment areas and outlines the necessary next steps . A mapping of all programmes in the five priority areas of the Framework supported by the country-specific meeting members was undertaken by the Peacebuilding Support Office and is being regularly updated . Immediately following the adoption of the Framework , the Sierra Leone country-specific meeting agreed on a six-month workplan for resource mobilization , outreach and advocacy . Subsequently , the Chairman of the Sierra Leone country-specific meeting undertook bilateral meetings with many member States and representatives of the international financial institutions , and visited capitals ( Washington , D. C. , London , Brussels , Berlin , and The Hague ) to garner political and financial support for the Framework and its implementation . The Framework was also transmitted to all relevant stakeholders through a joint letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sierra Leone and the Minister for Development Cooperation of the Netherlands . In order to broaden Sierra Leone 's donor base , the country-specific meeting Chairman convened meetings with representatives of the private sector , non-traditional donors and private foundations . These advocacy efforts culminated in a High-Level Stakeholders Consultation on the implementation of the Framework , held on 19 May in New York . Moving forward , the country-specific meeting would need to ensure that its advocacy efforts feed into the Sierra Leone Consultative Group meeting scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition to advocacy and resource mobilization , in the first half of 2008 , the country-specific meeting also focused on the issues of support to local council elections , fostering of national reconciliation and inter-party and intra-party dialogue , and the implementation of the energy sector emergency plan . In order to obtain first-hand information on the status of the implementation of the Framework and to raise international attention for Sierra Leone , a nine-member Peacebuilding Commission delegation visited the country from 1 to 7 June . The visit highlighted the progress made in the country and the need for continued international support for national reconciliation , greater political dialogue and more robust economic growth and job creation . The visit further reaffirmed the conclusions of the 19 May High-Level Stakeholders Consultation , namely that support to the efforts of the Government , to the extent possible , should be provided through direct budget support and sector programmes . In order for such assistance to be effective and targeted , the Government of Sierra Leone needs to develop sector-wide strategies , complete the drafting of the next poverty reduction strategy paper and revitalize in-country donor coordination mechanisms . In support of the lead role of the Government of Sierra Leone , the United Nations would need to maintain an integrated presence in the country with significantly strengthened capacity to provide high-quality technical advice and capacity-building support . C. Roles and responsibilities of the United Nations in support of the Framework The United Nations system in Sierra Leone , in accordance with the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone ( UNIOSIL ) , has been actively engaged in support of the Government in the implementation of the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework . United Nations efforts have been particularly effective in the areas of justice and security sector reform , preparations for the local council elections and the capacity-building of the National Human Rights Commission . Annex III to the present report provides additional details on implementation of United Nations commitments . The United Nations in Sierra Leone is currently undergoing a transition from UNIOSIL to an integrated Peacebuilding Support Office . This transition period provides further opportunities to strengthen the capacities of the United Nations to provide more targeted and effective support to the Government of Sierra Leone . In the justice sector , with the support of the Peacebuilding Fund , the United Nations has provided much-needed logistical support , including vehicles , computers and furniture . The Backlog Courts established under the Justice Sector Project have resolved 400 of an estimated 700 total backlog cases . To date , more than 100 judicial officers have undergone computer training . A six-month training programme for 20 legal executives was completed in the first week of June . Similarly , the training of 100 police prosecutors is now in progress . Magistrates have been assigned in all the districts and new judges have been appointed to the High Court and the Supreme Court . Notwithstanding these efforts , the justice sector continues to face challenges characterized by the delays in justice delivery , lack of adequate manpower in the judiciary and in the Ministry of Justice , logistical constraints of the police and poor prison conditions , including overcrowding . The United Nations has provided capacity-building and has supported the operationalization of the National Human Rights Commission . Over 28 staff members have been recruited and trained , various operational tools have been finalized and sent for legislative process and necessary logistics have been procured . Development of a five-year Strategic Action Plan for the Commission with clearly defined and costed priorities is also in progress . In collaboration with UNIOSIL , the Commission held a two-day consultative conference on the status of implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations and identified a number of strategies to facilitate the process . The Commission is also facilitating the formulation of a national action plan for human rights . A strategy for the formulation of the plan has been drafted and is being reviewed through a consultative process . The main challenge facing the Commission now is ensuring sustainability of its activities and long-term funding . In order to strengthen the Family Support Units of the Sierra Leone police , the Police Training Division , with the support of the United Nations , embarked on a project to create policies on sexual exploitation , sexual abuse and sexual harassment and on gender mainstreaming . In May 2008 , the two monumental policies were approved by the police executives . The next objective of the project will be to develop training modules and to conduct training workshops for the police force . Funding for this project was made possible by a grant from the Government of Norway . In line with the commitments of the Framework to enhance Sierra Leone 's participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operations , UNIOSIL has assisted and continues to assist the Sierra Leone police in preparing their officers to take part in the United Nations predeployment assessment . To date , the United Nations has assisted , mentored and prepared 20 Sierra Leone police officers currently deployed to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur . In addition , in June 2008 , the United Nations will conduct a second predeployment assessment of 88 Sierra Leone police officers in order to establish an eligibility list of officers available for United Nations peacekeeping deployment . Although the Sierra Leone police , with the assistance of the United Nations and Department for International Development ( United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) , has made tremendous strides to provide its officers and recruits with quality housing , a large number of officers and recruits live in substandard and deplorable conditions . In order to address this problem , the United Nations , in consultation with key members of the Sierra Leone police Executive Management Board , submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany . In 2008 , the Government of Germany approved a €1.4 million project to rehabilitate seven dormitories and barracks and one police station . The United Nations is working with both the Sierra Leone police and the German Government to expedite the completion of the project . In the lead-up to the 2008 local council elections , United Nations police advised and mentored the Sierra Leone police in the development of a national security operational plan and budget for every phase of the elections . In order to improve police accountability , the United Nations Police Professional Standards Adviser developed , organized and conducted training for 890 Sierra Leone police officers in the areas of ethics , code of conduct , human rights , discipline and regulations . Roles and responsibilities of the international partners The international community in Sierra Leone has been supporting the Government of Sierra Leone in the implementation of the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework . In the context of the finalization of the second-generation poverty reduction strategy paper , Sierra Leone 's development partners have also been actively engaged in the development of a national aid policy in line with the Paris Declaration , through their participation in the Donor Harmonization Task Force . In addition to the significant direct budget support provided to the Government of Sierra Leone by the four major partners , namely , the Department for International Development ( United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) , the European Union , the African Development Bank and the World Bank , a number of donors have continued to support the country in funding the various priority areas . The United States of America and Germany have continued to support interventions in the area of youth employment and empowerment . In the justice and security sectors , the Department for International Development ( United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) and the International Military Assistance Training Team continue to play a lead role , providing significant support , including in the implementation of the Justice Sector Development Programme and security sector reform strategies . Funding for the local council elections has been provided through generous support from a number of donors , especially the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , the European Union , Japan , Ireland and Norway , to the UNDP-managed elections basket fund , while other partners , such as the United States , also funded special election-related activities , such as support for women 's participation . Responding to an urgent request from the Government of Sierra Leone , the European Union , the Department for International Development , the African Development Bank , the World Bank and Italy have provided significant support for the completion of the Bambuna hydropower project and the implementation of the emergency energy plan . Other countries , such as China and Japan are also supporting the energy sector . Overall assessment of progress to date and emerging issues Significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Framework in the short time since its adoption . Notwithstanding these impressive developments , most notably in the areas of justice and security sector reform , anti-corruption activity , energy sector development and local council elections , there are a number of challenges involved in the implementation of the Framework which must be addressed in the next few months . The overall economic situation in Sierra Leone remains fragile . Furthermore , the global food crisis and rising oil prices risk undermining the efforts of the Government to provide long-awaited peace dividends and meet the high expectations of the population . President Koroma has stressed that starting in June 2008 , agricultural development and food security will become the top priority of the Government . The Government has already requested additional support in this area from Brazil , Canada and the United States . As the preparations for the local council elections have demonstrated , Sierra Leone remains divided along ethnic and geographic lines , requiring intensified efforts for national reconciliation and unity . Additional efforts are also needed to strengthen the national dispute resolution mechanisms . The Parliament has an important role to play and needs to be supported in a comprehensive and integrated manner . The Government of Sierra Leone is in the process of developing a new poverty reduction strategy paper . A first draft is expected at the end of June . All stakeholders will need to ensure that the drafting of the paper takes into account the provisions and commitments of the Framework . The success of the poverty reduction strategy paper will hinge on the availability of adequate capacities and resources . Drawing on previous experiences , the paper must be well prioritized and sequenced and finalized as soon as possible . The absence of a poverty reduction strategy paper since January 2008 has hindered the ability of some donors to release and commit funding . Since coming into office , the Government has been reviewing the existing aid coordination structure in Sierra Leone , which was headed by the Office of the Vice-President and included quarterly Development Partnership Committee meetings . Consequently , regular meetings between the Government of Sierra Leone and many of its international partners have been suspended , while some meetings are occurring between the Government and the four budget support donors . The Government needs to finalize and communicate its decisions on the aid coordination structure as soon as possible . The international partners , on the other hand , need to further harmonize their engagement frameworks and channel their support , to the extent possible , through budget support and sector-wide multi-donor funding mechanisms . Current multi-donor funding mechanisms need to be reviewed and enhanced to allow for greater donor participation . In the security sector , there is growing concern regarding the increased use of Sierra Leone as a transit country for narcotics . A Government of Sierra Leone inter-agency committee comprising the Office of National Security and the police has been set up to address the issue . The international community , and particularly the United Nations , needs to provide additional support in this area . Gender equality and women 's empowerment must be given additional attention in the implementation of the Framework . In particular , law enforcement agencies and the judiciary need to conduct training on the recently adopted gender bills to ensure their full use and implementation . Efforts to simplify the provisions of the bills and to conduct awareness-raising and trainings with women 's groups and the Sierra Leone police and judiciary need to be supported and prioritized .
