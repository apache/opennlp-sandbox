Part I Finalized draft text of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence* Explanatory note The Rules of Procedure and Evidence are an instrument for the application of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , to which they are subordinate in all cases . In elaborating the Rules of Procedure and Evidence , care has been taken to avoid rephrasing and , to the extent possible , repeating the provisions of the Statute .

The Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Court do not affect the procedural rules for any national court or legal system for the purpose of national proceedings .

The Assembly of States Parties is invited to give further consideration to this issue .

Before testifying , the witness shall be informed of the offence defined in article 70 , paragraph 1 ( a ) . Rule 67 Live testimony by means of audio or video-link technology In accordance with article 69 , paragraph 2 , a Chamber may allow a witness to give viva voce ( oral ) testimony before the Chamber by means of audio or video technology , provided that such technology permits the witness to be examined by the Prosecutor , the defence , and by the Chamber itself , at the time that the witness so testifies .

Rule 69 Agreements as to evidence The Prosecutor and the defence may agree that an alleged fact , which is contained in the charges , the contents of a document , the expected testimony of a witness or other evidence is not contested and , accordingly , a Chamber may consider such alleged fact as being proven , unless the Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the alleged facts is required in the interests of justice , in particular the interests of the victims . Rule 70 Principles of evidence in cases of sexual violence In cases of sexual violence , the Court shall be guided by and , where appropriate , apply the following principles : ( a ) Consent cannot be inferred by reason of any words or conduct of a victim where force , threat of force , coercion or taking advantage of a coercive environment undermined the victim 's ability to give voluntary and genuine consent ; ( b ) Consent cannot be inferred by reason of any words or conduct of a victim where the victim is incapable of giving genuine consent ; ( c ) Consent cannot be inferred by reason of the silence of , or lack of resistance by , a victim to the alleged sexual violence ; ( d ) Credibility , character or predisposition to sexual availability of a victim or witness cannot be inferred by reason of the sexual nature of the prior or subsequent conduct of a victim or witness . Rule 71 Evidence of other sexual conduct In the light of the definition and nature of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court , and subject to article 69 , paragraph 4 , a Chamber shall not admit evidence of the prior or subsequent sexual conduct of a victim or witness . Rule 72 In camera procedure to consider relevance or admissibility of evidence Where there is an intention to introduce or elicit , including by means of the questioning of a victim or witness , evidence that the victim consented to an alleged crime of sexual violence , or evidence of the words , conduct , silence or lack of resistance of a victim or witness as referred to in principles ( a ) through ( d ) of rule 70 , notification shall be provided to the Court which shall describe the substance of the evidence intended to be introduced or elicited and the relevance of the evidence to the issues in the case . In deciding whether the evidence referred to in sub-rule 1 is relevant or admissible , a Chamber shall hear in camera the views of the Prosecutor , the defence , the witness and the victim or his or her legal representative , if any , and shall take into account whether that evidence has a sufficient degree of probative value to an issue in the case and the prejudice that such evidence may cause , in accordance with article 69 , paragraph 4. For this purpose , the Chamber shall have regard to article 21 , paragraph 3 , and articles 67 and 68 , and shall be guided by principles ( a ) to ( d ) of rule 70 , especially with respect to the proposed questioning of a victim . Where the Chamber determines that the evidence referred to in sub-rule 2 is admissible in the proceedings , the Chamber shall state on the record the specific purpose for which the evidence is admissible . In evaluating the evidence during the proceedings , the Chamber shall apply principles ( a ) to ( d ) of rule 70. Rule 73 Privileged communications and information Without prejudice to article 67 , paragraph 1 ( b ) , communications made in the context of the professional relationship between a person and his or her legal counsel shall be regarded as privileged , and consequently not subject to disclosure , unless : ( a ) The person consents in writing to such disclosure ; or ( b ) The person voluntarily disclosed the content of the communication to a third party , and that third party then gives evidence of that disclosure . Having regard to rule 63 , sub-rule 5 , communications made in the context of a class of professional or other confidential relationships shall be regarded as privileged , and consequently not subject to disclosure , under the same terms as in sub-rules 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) if a Chamber decides in respect of that class that : ( a ) Communications occurring within that class of relationship are made in the course of a confidential relationship producing a reasonable expectation of privacy and non-disclosure ; ( b ) Confidentiality is essential to the nature and type of relationship between the person and the confidant ; and ( c ) Recognition of the privilege would further the objectives of the Statute and the Rules .

The Court shall regard as privileged , and consequently not subject to disclosure , including by way of testimony of any present or past official or employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , any information , documents or other evidence which it came into the possession of in the course , or as a consequence , of the performance by ICRC of its functions under the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement , unless : ( a ) After consultations undertaken pursuant to sub-rule 6 , ICRC does not object in writing to such disclosure , or otherwise has waived this privilege ; or ( b ) Such information , documents or other evidence is contained in public statements and documents of ICRC . Nothing in sub-rule 4 shall affect the admissibility of the same evidence obtained from a source other than ICRC and its officials or employees when such evidence has also been acquired by this source independently of ICRC and its officials or employees . If the Court determines that ICRC information , documents or other evidence are of great importance for a particular case , consultations shall be held between the Court and ICRC in order to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative means , bearing in mind the circumstances of the case , the relevance of the evidence sought , whether the evidence could be obtained from a source other than ICRC , the interests of justice and of victims , and the performance of the Court 's and ICRC 's functions . Rule 74 Self-incrimination by a witness Unless a witness has been notified pursuant to rule 190 , the Chamber shall notify a witness of the provisions of this rule before his or her testimony . Where the Court determines that an assurance with respect to self-incrimination should be provided to a particular witness , it shall provide the assurances under sub-rule 3 , paragraph ( c ) , before the witness attends , directly or pursuant to a request under article 93 , paragraph ( 1 ) ( e ) . ( a ) A witness may object to making any statement that might tend to incriminate him or her . ( b ) Where the witness has attended after receiving an assurance under sub-rule 2 , the Court may require the witness to answer the question or questions . ( c ) In the case of other witnesses , the Chamber may require the witness to answer the question or questions , after assuring the witness that the evidence provided in response to the questions : ( i ) Will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed to the public or any State ; and ( ii ) Will not be used either directly or indirectly against that person in any subsequent prosecution by the Court , except under articles 70 and 71. Before giving such an assurance , the Chamber shall seek the views of the Prosecutor , ex parte , to determine if the assurance should be given to this particular witness . In determining whether to require the witness to answer , the Chamber shall consider : ( a ) The importance of the anticipated evidence ; ( b ) Whether the witness would be providing unique evidence ; ( c ) The nature of the possible incrimination , if known ; and ( d ) The sufficiency of the protections for the witness , in the particular circumstances . If the Chamber determines that it would not be appropriate to provide an assurance to this witness , it shall not require the witness to answer the question . If the Chamber determines not to require the witness to answer , it may still continue the questioning of the witness on other matters . In order to give effect to the assurance , the Chamber shall : ( a ) Order that the evidence of the witness be given in camera ; ( b ) Order that the identity of the witness and the content of the evidence given shall not be disclosed , in any manner , and provide that the breach of any such order will be subject to sanction under article 71 ; ( c ) Specifically advise the Prosecutor , the accused , the defence counsel , the legal representative of the victim and any Court staff present of the consequences of a breach of the order under subparagraph ( b ) ; ( d ) Order the sealing of any record of the proceedings ; and ( e ) Use protective measures with respect to any decision of the Court to ensure that the identity of the witness and the content of the evidence given are not disclosed .

Rule 75 Incrimination by family members A witness appearing before the Court , who is a spouse , child or parent of an accused person , shall not be required by a Chamber to make any statement that might tend to incriminate that accused person . However , the witness may choose to make such a statement . In evaluating the testimony of a witness , a Chamber may take into account that the witness , referred to in sub-rule 1 , objected to reply to a question which was intended to contradict a previous statement made by the witness , or the witness was selective in choosing which questions to answer . Section II Disclosure Rule 76 Pre-trial disclosure relating to prosecution witnesses The Prosecutor shall provide the defence with the names of witnesses whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify and copies of any prior statements made by those witnesses .

The Chamber dealing with the matter may grant the Prosecutor an adjournment to address the issue raised by the defence . Failure of the defence to provide notice under this rule shall not limit its right to raise matters dealt with in sub-rule 1 and to present evidence . This rule does not prevent a Chamber from ordering disclosure of any other evidence . Rule 80 Procedures for raising a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under article 31 , paragraph 3 The defence shall give notice to both the Trial Chamber and the Prosecutor if it intends to raise a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under article 31 , paragraph 3.

If the defence is permitted to raise the ground , the Trial Chamber may grant the Prosecutor an adjournment to address that ground . Rule 81 Restrictions on disclosure Reports , memoranda or other internal documents prepared by a party , its assistants or representatives in connection with the investigation or preparation of the case are not subject to disclosure .

The matter shall be heard on an ex parte basis by the Chamber . However , the Prosecutor may not introduce such material or information into evidence during the confirmation hearing or the trial without adequate prior disclosure to the accused . Where steps have been taken to ensure the confidentiality of information , in accordance with articles 54 , 57 , 64 , 72 and 93 , and , in accordance with article 68 , to protect the safety of witnesses and victims and members of their families , such information shall not be disclosed , except in accordance with those articles . When the disclosure of such information may create a risk to the safety of the witness , the Court shall take measures to inform the witness in advance . The Chamber dealing with the matter shall , on its own motion or at the request of the Prosecutor , the accused or any State , take the necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality of information , in accordance with articles 54 , 72 and 93 , and , in accordance with article 68 , to protect the safety of witnesses and victims and members of their families , including by authorizing the non-disclosure of their identity prior to the commencement of the trial . Where material or information is in the possession or control of the Prosecutor which is withheld under article 68 , paragraph 5 , such material and information may not be subsequently introduced into evidence during the confirmation hearing or the trial without adequate prior disclosure to the accused . Where material or information is in the possession or control of the defence which is subject to disclosure , it may be withheld in circumstances similar to those which would allow the Prosecutor to rely on article 68 , paragraph 5 , and a summary thereof submitted instead . Such material and information may not be subsequently introduced into evidence during the confirmation hearing or the trial without adequate prior disclosure to the Prosecutor . Rule 82 Restrictions on disclosure of material and information protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) Where material or information is in the possession or control of the Prosecutor which is protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , the Prosecutor may not subsequently introduce such material or information into evidence without the prior consent of the provider of the material or information and adequate prior disclosure to the accused . If the Prosecutor introduces material or information protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , into evidence , a Chamber may not order the production of additional evidence received from the provider of the initial material or information , nor may a Chamber for the purpose of obtaining such additional evidence itself summon the provider or a representative of the provider as a witness or order their attendance . If the Prosecutor calls a witness to introduce in evidence any material or information which has been protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , a Chamber may not compel that witness to answer any question relating to the material or information or its origin , if the witness declines to answer on grounds of confidentiality . The right of the accused to challenge evidence which has been protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , shall remain unaffected subject only to the limitations contained in sub-rules 2 and 3. A Chamber dealing with the matter may order , upon application by the defence , that , in the interests of justice , material or information in the possession of the accused , which has been provided to the accused under the same conditions as set forth in article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , and which is to be introduced into evidence , shall be subject mutatis mutandis to sub-rules 1 , 2 and 3.

If the victims are unable to choose a common legal representative or representatives within a time limit that the Chamber may decide , the Chamber may request the Registrar to choose one or more common legal representatives . The Chamber and the Registry shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that in the selection of common legal representatives , the distinct interests of the victims , particularly as provided in article 68 , paragraph 1 , are represented and that any conflict of interest is avoided . A victim or group of victims who lack the necessary means to pay for a common legal representative chosen by the Court may receive assistance from the Registry , including , as appropriate , financial assistance .

The Chamber may require the legal representative to provide a written note of the questions and in that case the questions shall be communicated to the Prosecutor and , if appropriate , the defence , who shall be allowed to make observations within a time limit set by the Chamber . ( b ) The Chamber shall then issue a ruling on the request , taking into account the stage of the proceedings , the rights of the accused , the interests of witnesses , the need for a fair , impartial and expeditious trial and in order to give effect to article 68 , paragraph 3.

In that case , the legal representative may , with the permission of the Chamber concerned , question witnesses , experts and the person concerned .

The Registrar shall also , having regard to any information provided by the Prosecutor , take all the necessary measures to give adequate publicity of the reparation proceedings before the Court , to the extent possible , to other victims , interested persons and interested States . In taking the measures described in sub-rule 1 , the Court may seek , in accordance with Part 9 , the cooperation of relevant States Parties , and seek the assistance of intergovernmental organizations in order to give publicity , as widely as possible and by all possible means , to the reparation proceedings before the Court .

The award for reparations thus deposited in the Trust Fund shall be separated from other resources of the Trust Fund and shall be forwarded to each victim as soon as possible . The Court may order that an award for reparations against a convicted person be made through the Trust Fund where the number of the victims and the scope , forms and modalities of reparations makes a collective award more appropriate . Following consultations with interested States and the Trust Fund , the Court may order that an award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund to an intergovernmental , international or national organization approved by the Trust Fund . Other resources of the Trust Fund may be used for the benefit of victims subject to the provisions of article 79.

In the latter case , the Registrar shall provide notification of the proceedings to the person against whom a request is made and so far as is possible to any interested persons or interested States . If an order is made without prior notification , the relevant Chamber shall request the Registrar , as soon as is consistent with the effectiveness of the measures requested , to notify those against whom a request is made and , to the extent possible , to any interested persons or any interested States and invite them to make observations as to whether the order should be revoked or otherwise modified .
