Abdullah , Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , addressed to you ( see annex ) . I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly and of the Security Council . ( Signed ) Dr. Ravan Farhâdi Ambassador Permanent Representative Annex to the identical letters dated 23 January 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council Following the convening of the meeting in Akora Khattak , Pakistan , on 10 January 2001 of the Pakistan-based extremist groups , advocating maximized military support of Pakistan to the Taliban-Osama coalition , and defying the United Nations sanctions against the militia , the Pakistan military junta has brought in new military force in northern Afghanistan . Reports gathered recently by the security services of the Islamic State of Afghanistan indicate that since 12 January 2001 , a number of new commando and artillery units of the Pakistan Army have been deployed in northern Afghanistan , in preparation for foreseeable attacks on the government forces . According to the reports , in a sweeping move , preceding the deadline of the imposition of the new United Nations sanctions against the Taliban mercenaries , Pakistan army officers and units have recently been posted to Afghanistan as follows : General Qamar-u-Zaman of the Pakistan Army has been assigned as the new officer in charge of military operations in Afghanistan , replacing Pakistan 's General of the Army Saeed Zafar , who functioned in the same capacity in Afghanistan over the past year ; General Tariq Bashir , formerly commander of the Ninth Commando Division of the Pakistan Army ; Brigadier Momin of the Kohat Division of the Pakistan Army ; Colonel Sanaullah of the Kohat Division of the Pakistan Army ; Colonel Hamza of Pakistan 's military intelligence services ( ISI ) ; The 998 Brigade has been replaced by the 996 Brigade of Charat Commando Divisions , under Brigadier Amjad of Sayawali , Pakistan ; The 117 Brigade has been replaced by the 994 Brigade , under Faizan Khan of Laki Maroot , Pakistan ; The 625 Artillery Battalion has been newly deployed in the northern Kunduz province , under ranking officer Rafique of the Pakistan Army ; Brigadier Amjad has been assigned as the commanding officer of Pakistan attacking forces in the northern Takhar province . The Pakistan Army units operating under Brigadier Amjad are reported to have been especially equipped with infrastructure capability to cross the Kokcha River , where the government forces are entrenched ; The 998 Brigade has been withdrawn from the fronts , and designated as the Reserve Corps , to take over the ongoing routine military training in preparation for future deployments across Afghanistan ; The total additional number of armed Pakistan nationals , recently dispatched to northern Afghanistan , is estimated at about 1,500 . According to the reports , Pakistan forces have joined scores of heavily armed militants from the Osama bin Laden Al-Qaeda terrorist network and a sizeable number of Taliban mercenaries , already poised to attack territories across the Kokcha River on the border of Badakhshan province in the north-east . An attack by the Pakistan-Taliban-Osama forces on 12 January , targeting Khoja-Ghar , Dasht-e-Qala and Ay Khanum along the same area was beaten back fiercely by the government troops , with as many as 200 Taliban dead and heavy material losses . The convening of the Akora Khattak meeting in broad daylight by as many as 30 militant groups , protected by hundreds of heavily armed guards of their own , while martial law imposed by the military Government of Pakistan remains in effect throughout the country , among other things , serves as ample proof that the gathering was orchestrated by the Government of Pakistan aimed at intensifying and prolonging the war in Afghanistan and yet misleading the international community . The gathering , attended by top-ranking officers of the Pakistan ISI , such as General ( retired ) Hamid Gul , former Chief of military intelligence services and General Aslam Beg of the Pakistan Army , starkly unravels Pakistan 's un-Islamic exploitation of religion for its unholy military and political hegemonic purposes , while bringing to light the treacherous and bogus preaching of the Pakistan political and military establishment concerning the “ negative impacts of the United Nations sanctions on the civilian population of Afghanistan ” . The current surge in Pakistan military involvement in Afghanistan clearly manifests Pakistan 's belligerence against the Security Council resolution , that , inter alia , calls for an embargo on provision of arms and military aid to the Taliban , immediate withdrawal of foreign military personnel from Afghanistan and closure of all terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan .
