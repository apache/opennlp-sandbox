Agenda The situation between Iraq and Kuwait The meeting was called to order at 10.17 a. m. Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted . The situation between Iraq and Kuwait The President : The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda . The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations . At this meeting , the Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr. John Negroponte , the representative of the United States . Mr. Negroponte ( United States of America ) : On behalf of the Member States contributing forces , I am pleased to report to the Security Council on the efforts and progress of the multinational force authorized under Security Council resolution 1511 ( 2003 ) . Together with our multinational force partners , the United States remains committed to a secure , stable and democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbours . To that end , the multinational force and Iraqi security forces are working together to provide security for the Iraqi people and to defeat those who seek to destabilize Iraq . The Security Council adopted resolution 1511 ( 2003 ) in the wake of a series of violent incidents directed against the Iraqi people and members of the international community , including the United Nations . Resolution 1511 ( 2003 ) recognizes that international support for the restoration of conditions of stability and security in Iraq is essential for the well-being of the Iraqi people , for their ability to elect a new Government under a permanent constitution and for the ability of all concerned to carry out their work on behalf of the people of Iraq . The events of recent days demonstrate yet again that there are those who believe that they should decide Iraq 's political future through violence . Yet only peace and justice , enforced by the rule of law and not by the gun , and freedom from fear of terror or a return of former regime elements will enable all Iraqi citizens to participate fully in political and economic life . All of us gathered here mourn the loss of life in Iraq , among members of the multinational force and Iraqi and international civilians . But let me be very clear : we will stay the course . In addition to the United States , the multinational force comprises more than 30 countries contributing a total of approximately 24,000 personnel . The multinational force is divided into three sectors : centre-south , south-east and northern Iraq , which includes Baghdad . Forces in all sectors are engaged in stability operations , reconstruction efforts , the training of Iraqi security forces and civil affairs training . As recent days have vividly demonstrated , threat elements continue to challenge all those who are working for a better Iraq . We have witnessed ambush and mutilation , riots and attacks , perpetrated by three groups : insurgents including former regime loyalists , terrorists who have infiltrated Iraq and militias affiliated with radical elements . The violence has been terrible and the losses great . In fulfilling the Security Council 's mandate “ to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq ” ( resolution 1511 ( 2003 ) , para . 13 ) , the multinational force has conducted the full spectrum of military operations , which range from the provision of humanitarian assistance , civil affairs and relief and reconstruction activities to the detention of those who are threats to security , looking for and securing weapons that threaten Iraq 's stability , intelligence-gathering and , when necessary , offensive combat operations against insurgents , terrorists and others . Against the backdrop of continued threat , the multinational force has performed or assisted in many humanitarian and reconstruction activities throughout Iraq , in all of the division sectors . Assistance has been provided by all soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines assigned to the multinational force as well as by civil affairs personnel . The initial focus of humanitarian and reconstruction activities was the restoration of essential services for restoring electricity to homes , public facilities and business . That was critical to returning normal life to the Iraqis . Engineering units have been key in helping restore power to levels that now exceed pre-conflict levels in both the North and the South of Iraq , and units of the multinational force have helped to provide security for key infrastructure until the Iraqi Facilities Protection Service could take on that role . Multinational force engineering units have helped repair numerous bridges , ports , roads and railroads . But multinational force units have been involved in much more than large engineering projects . Multinational force tactical units have assisted in local construction projects throughout Iraq , resulting in the construction and repair of schools , hospitals , post offices and other public buildings . Multinational force explosive ordinance disposal units have disposed of thousands of tons of captured or found Iraqi ammunition , including mines . Multinational force medical units have treated Iraqi civilians throughout the country and have assisted in children 's vaccination programmes . All multinational force units in all sectors have assisted in the distribution of the new Iraqi dinars over the past several months . Perhaps the longest-lasting contribution multinational force units may make is in the area of local governance . Civil affairs personnel have been crucial elements of the seed of Iraqi democracy , working daily to help Iraqis form the basis of a civil democratic society . These civil affairs personnel are active in all 18 governorates and have helped form 17 governorate councils , 78 city councils , 102 district and sub-district councils and 138 neighbourhood councils , giving a genuine political voice to millions of Iraqis for the first time in decades . In addition to the broad-based efforts of the multinational force that I have described , one of its key long-term objectives is to recruit , train and equip Iraqi security forces in preparation for their assumption of the responsibility for maintaining security and enforcing the rule of law . This is both a major challenge for the multinational force and a work in progress , requiring continued multinational force support . The multinational force has made significant progress in standing up Iraqi security forces , given the vacuum created by the dissolution of the Iraqi police and armed forces when Iraq was liberated . Despite the increase in attacks targeting Iraqi security forces , Iraqis continue to join and the multinational force is methodically working to build professional entities to provide a stabilizing influence , from routine civil policing to combating terrorism throughout the country . Iraqis know the rhythms of their neighbourhoods , the language and the culture and are best equipped to provide a long-term security solution . Their involvement is therefore critical to combating successfully threats from hostile elements that remain currently active in Iraq . At the beginning of April 2004 , approximately 200,000 members of Iraqi security forces were either on duty or in training . Clearly , however , numbers are only part of what makes security forces effective . The development of competent leaders is critical and takes time . The multinational force will be engaged on a priority basis in both the development of leaders and in specialist training in the months ahead . In February , when I reported on the implementation of resolution 1483 ( 2003 ) , I provided a comprehensive description of the various Iraqi security forces — specifically , the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps , the Iraqi police service , the Facilities Protection Service , the new Iraq armed forces and border security . I would like to take this opportunity to provide the Council with a brief further update . The Iraqi Civil Defence Corps , which now totals approximately 32,000 Iraqis , is designed to support local and regional police efforts . The Civil Defence Corps performs a range of duties , including fixed-site security , convoy security , patrols , cordons , the establishment of checkpoints and other tasks under the operational control of the multinational force . The Iraqi police service also has continued to grow and , as of the beginning of April , over 75,000 police officers were on duty or in training . The Facilities Protection Service , charged with protecting Iraq 's strategic infrastructure , Government buildings and cultural and educational assets , also has increased in number to approximately 74,000 personnel overall . From 1 March of this year , each of Iraq 's ministries has responsibility for the hiring , payment , equipment and training of its individual guards . As of 9 April , the Iraqi armed forces had nearly 4,000 personnel on duty , many of whom have participated in military operations against insurgents and terrorists under the operational control of the multinational force . Lastly , the Iraqi border police and immigration and customs inspectors totalled approximately 23,000 at the end of March . Necessary equipment is flowing in and training has been integrated into the Baghdad Public Service Academy . I note that , while we have made substantial progress in securing Iraqi borders , much work still needs to be accomplished . I have just described the range of Iraqi security forces and want to stress a related issue that has become all the more critical in light of recent events . As President Bush stressed on 13 April , there is no place for armed militias in Iraq . Our objective is to establish the rule of law in a democratic Iraq and to prevent any party from exercising influence through violent means . Many Iraqis have expressed strong support for the end of militias and armed groups outside of the legitimate Iraqi security services . The Coalition Provisional Authority is engaged in productive negotiations to ensure the transition and reintegration of all armed organizations not under Government control . Progress has been made , but we will have no choice but to deal firmly with those who refuse to negotiate . Resolution 1511 ( 2003 ) authorized the multinational force to contribute to the security of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq . The United States is committed to working with the international community to ensure that the security needs of the United Nations are met , both before and after 30 June . In January of this year , a United Nations team of security experts began working in Iraq to establish a strong relationship with the multinational force to facilitate the return of international United Nations personnel . We continue to work with the United Nations team to this day , including in such areas as identifying potential facilities for United Nations operations , and we have worked closely with United Nations security personnel in coordinating effective security for the important United Nations missions which have been deployed to Iraq — the teams of both Ambassador Brahimi and Miss Pirelli — in support of their work . With the support of the United Nations , the United States has begun to solicit force contributions for the protection of a broad-based United Nations mission , whose role will be further defined by Security Council action . Operating as part of the multinational force , such forces would be dedicated solely to providing security for United Nations personnel and facilities . I believe that I do not overstate the broad desire within the international community for the United Nations to return to Iraq to play an expansive , robust and vital role , in particular after the 30 June transition . In this regard , I urge that Member States contribute to the future of Iraq by providing troops to carry out the function of security support for the essential United Nations role . Member States should contact my delegation or other Coalition members as soon as possible . The end of the occupation and the assumption of governing authority by the Iraqi interim Government on 30 June will mark the beginning of a new era for the people of Iraq . Ambassador Brahimi has consulted with a wide range of Iraqis both inside and beyond the Governing Council over the past 10 days , and just two days ago he outlined his preliminary recommendations for the transition process . The United States welcomes his highly constructive recommendations and looks forward to hearing about them in greater detail . The Coalition 's commitment to Iraq will continue well beyond 30 June , nonetheless . The transfer of sovereignty will not bring total calm to Iraq , and the multinational force will be needed in Iraq to continue to support Iraq 's security forces until they can assume sole responsibility for the security and stability of their country . In the months to come , we will witness continuing efforts by a new Government to further develop institutions of democracy and take on the critical task of preparing elections for the transitional National Assembly , which will subsequently draft a new constitution . That new Government will be challenged by those who are now , and have been , challenging the Iraqi security forces and the multinational force , those who believe that the indiscriminate targeting of the Iraqi people and the international community will erode our shared resolve to see Iraq through a successful political transition . But together with our partners in the international community and the Iraqi people , we will continue to stand fast , anchored by the vision of a stable and secure Iraq at peace with its peoples and its neighbours . The President : In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council 's prior consultations , I should now like to invite Council members to informal consultations to continue our discussion on the subject .
