Letter dated 5 July 2006 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council Upon instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit herewith a cable message dated 4 July 2006 from Lam Akol Ajawin , Minister for Foreign Affairs , to the President of the Security Council concerning the aggressions by the so called National Redemption Front ( see annex ) , NRF , carried out against the town of Hamrat al-Sheikh in North Kordofan State , in an attempt to impede the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement . I would highly appreciate if you could have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council . ( Signed ) Omar B. Manis Chargé d'affaires a. i. Annex to the letter dated 5 July 2006 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council [ Original : Arabic ] At a time when the Government of National Unity and its partners from the Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLM ) are intent on implementing the Darfur Peace Agreement , we regret to inform you of a treacherous act of aggression perpetrated with the aim of wrecking the Darfur Peace Agreement in its early stages and extinguishing the glimmer of hope for the restoration of peace and stability in the Darfur region . This act constitutes a blatant challenge to the will for peace and to the will of the international community , in particular the Security Council . It is hardly surprising that such an act of aggression should have been perpetrated at this time by a group that openly refused to sign the Agreement and publicly declared its resolve to torpedo it . On 3 June , a group calling itself the National Redemption Front ( NRF ) carried out a full military attack on the town of Hamrat al-Sheikh , located in Northern Kordafan . Targeted at the town 's public amenities , the attack caused loss of life and property , in addition to which there was widespread looting of both public and private property . It should be noted that the NRF , which was formed on 30 June 2006 in the Eritrean capital , Asmara , is an alliance composed of groups that refused to sign the Darfur Peace Agreement . Its founding declaration was signed by Mr. Khalil Ibrahim , Chairman of the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) , Mr. Ahmed Ibrahim Diraig and Mr. Sharif Harir for the Sudanese Federal Democratic Alliance ( SFDA ) , and Mr. Khamis Abdalla Abakr , SLM dissident . The group responsible for the attack unhesitatingly declared that it would be pursuing its acts of sabotage in order to undermine the Peace Agreement . Moreover , as indicated in the communiqué annexed hereto , it affirmed that , as far as it was concerned , the Darfur Peace Agreement was simply a lie . In bringing this regrettable incident to your attention , it is our assertion that the group would never have dared to take such action unless it had been fully confident that it would not be held to account . We therefore emphasize that the credibility of the Security Council is now being directly tested , the question being whether it is able to deter saboteurs and put a stop to those who have set about destroying the Darfur Peace Agreement . This treacherous aggression constitutes an immediate threat to the Peace Agreement , takes the war beyond Darfur and is a flagrant violation of the cease-fire agreements , as well as a blatant defiance of all Security Council resolutions on Darfur , in particular resolution 1591 ( 2005 ) . The Government of the Sudan calls on the Security Council to shoulder its full responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations for the purpose of protecting the Darfur Peace Agreement and to take decisive and comprehensive measures against this treacherous group as a deterrent to anyone planning to destroy the Agreement . ( Signed ) Lam Akol Ajawin Minister for Foreign Affairs President of the Security Council United Nations New York Enclosure : Text of the communiqué issued by the group which carried out the attack Military communiqué No. 1/Sudanese National Redemption Front Today , 3 July 2006 , the forces of the National Redemption Front ( NRF ) seized the strategic town of Hamrat al-Sheikh , which is situated 200 kilometres north-west of the capital , Khartoum , in the Kordofan region . Our forces succeeded in destroying two brigades of government forces deployed as an advance force to protect the capital , Khartoum . The NRF forces also eliminated the security and police forces stationed in the region , in addition to which they seized all ammunition , weapons and equipped military vehicles belonging to the government forces . Our forces also captured a large number of the defeated forces . The NRF forces are heading towards the capital , Khartoum . The NRF offers this victory in the service of all the marginalized and oppressed people of Darfur and refutes the lie that peace and stability have been restored to the country . The NRF forces affirm that the struggle will continue until the fall of the genocidal regime in Khartoum . “ The unjust will soon know how terrible their end will be . ” Commander Abdullah Bandah Abakr Commander Adam Bakhit Liberated territories - Hamrat al-Sheikh 3 July 2006
