Letter dated 21 August 2000 from the Permanent Representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to inform you that troops from the regular Ugandan army are preparing a large-scale offensive in Equateur province . Those troops are being reinforced by Ugandan units formerly based in Kisangani , which were obliged to withdraw in order to permit administrative control of that city by the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Ugandan arms and munitions from Kisangani are being transferred to Buta , from where they are being sent through a number of aerial rotations on to the Gbadolite , Gemena and Libenge fronts . Accordingly , munitions for heavy artillery were recently disembarked in Gemena . Likewise , Ugandan tanks have been positioned on the front line in the Mawiya region , 500 kilometres south of Gbadolite , and Ugandan troops are again being deployed to support Libenge . It is feared that all of this activity in Equateur province foreshadows a non-stop Ugandan military offensive against positions of the Congolese armed forces . My Government regrets this fresh violation of resolution 1304 ( 2000 ) , adopted by the Security Council on 16 June 2000. My Government requests the Council to implement fully the aforementioned resolution , which under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , inter alia : Demanded that Ugandan and Rwandan forces as well as forces of the Congolese armed opposition and other armed groups immediately and completely withdraw from Kisangani ; Also demanded that Uganda and Rwanda , which have violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , withdraw all their forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo without further delay ; Further demanded that all other foreign military presence and activity , direct and indirect , in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo be brought to an end ; In this context , demanded that all parties abstain from any offensive action during the process of disengagement and of withdrawal of foreign forces . I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a Security Council document . ( Signed ) Andr√© Mwamba Kapanga Ambassador Permanent Representative
