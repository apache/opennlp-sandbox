Green MEP Calls for Climate Change ' Revolution ' 30th Jun 2005 Top Green challenges Bush and Blair at alternative G8 Summit WORLD leaders gathering in Gleneagles next week must embrace a ' climate change revolution ' and slash military spending if they hope to make real progress on tackling extreme poverty in Africa , according to Euro-MP Caroline Lucas . The South-East England MEP and Green Party principal speaker will make her comments during an alternative G8 counter-summit at venues around Edinburgh next Sunday ( July 3rd ) . " Tony Blair has promised to make tackling climate change and extreme poverty in Africa his two priorities during his presidency of the G8 , " she will say at the ' G8 Corporate dream ... Global Nightmare ' conference . " But if he is to have any success he will have to accept - and persuade George Bush and other G8 leaders to accept - that these challenges are simply different sides of the same coin . " Both extreme poverty in the developing world and runaway greenhouse gas emissions which are fuelling climate change - which Tony Blair has himself describes as ' the greatest threat we face ' - are inevitable consequences of the G8 countries ' relentless pursuit of ever freer international trade and economic globalisation . " If the G8 leaders are serious about tackling these problems they will have to accept that social and environmental protection require stepping back from the goal of forcing open ever-more developing markets to unfettered free trade - and replacing their goal of increased economic growth with the pursuit of increased economic , social and environmental security . " Dr Lucas will join a roll-call of green and progressive thinkers - including George Monbiot , Trevor Ngwame , Walden Bello and ' The Yes Men ' - at the conference , which has been organized by the World Development Movement , Friends of the Earth , War on Want and People & Planet . She will address the conference on ' Challenging Climate Change ' and promote efforts by Green Members of the Scottish Parliament to win support for a Climate Change Bill . Greens today ( June 29^th ) launched a consultation with their MSP colleagues about the proposed Bill , which would make Scottish Ministers legally responsible for setting emission reduction targets and delivering changes in policy across areas that include transport , housing , education and agriculture . " In the lead up to G8 , the Scottish Parliament is being encouraged to set an example to the rest of the world and be part of the climate change solution , rather than part of the problem . I hope that MSPs show they have more courage and a greater sense of responsibility than the G8 leaders who , it is rumored , have already watered down the action they plan to take . " Dr Lucas will then join a panel discussion on ' Militarism and Nuclearism ' with CND chair Kate Hudson . " Ever freer international trade will not tackle extreme poverty or climate change - we must ' tame the beast ' of economic globalisation and allow poorer nations to do what the US and EU have always done : to intervene in their foreign trade to set their own priorities , " added Dr Lucas . " The challenge facing the G8 leaders is to set binding targets for reducing emissions reductions and to slash military expenditure , which is diverting funds from development aid .
