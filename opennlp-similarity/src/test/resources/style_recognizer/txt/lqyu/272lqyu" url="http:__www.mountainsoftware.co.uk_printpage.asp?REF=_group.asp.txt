Mountain Software has been supplying software products since the mid 1970 's when a Partnership was formed by six individuals with a range of expertise in the computer industry . The team worked on an array of projects and in 1978 won their first legal client following an IT show . With IT being an emerging science in the legal market place , there were few packages available for small practices to differentiate between the Client Account and General Office funds . For this first client , the software that was produced created that differentiation , thus sowing the seeds of the early PMS ( Practice Management System ) . Building on this , Mountain Software developed its accounting package , time recording systems and case management modules . As the market requirements changed , modules were added , with 14 now in existence . Mountain Software still has that very first client as a loyal user who plays an active role in its continuing development by being Chairman of the User Group . As the company grew , it established itself in the supply of hardware and supporting services . Mountain Software is now able to offer full IT services , from networks , cabling , internet & web services , hardware - PCs , servers , telephony , as well as software . To support its clients , Mountain Software offers comprehensive training services , helpdesks as well as consultancy to ensure that each client understands what is available to him and how best to set up and maintain his IT infrastructure . In 2000 , Mountain Software entered the Coroners ' market and now has over 92 % of the market in England and Wales . In 2002 , it entered the Barristers ' market with two significant acquisitions and now has over 95 % of the market in England and Wales . In 2004 , it acquired G. B . Systems giving it a 25 % share of the Solicitors ' market in Scotland . This is in addition to its 500 existing clients .
