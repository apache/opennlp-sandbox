Learning & Further Education - Michael My name is Michael . I am 17 years old and I have been to 2 different colleges . I had learning support when I was in school because I have a learning difficulty . I first found out about Workforce through my careers office . I went for an induction and they showed me round the building . I worked through a couple of assessments to decide what level I should work at . T hen I had an interview . I had to bring my National Record of Achievement , Birth Certificate , GCSE certificates and my National Insurance number - you get paid a small sum of money for coming to Workforce . As I did n't have very good grades , they started me on a Lifeskills course . M y main reason for coming to Workforce was to improve my grades . I wanted to get an NVQ in IT , but first I had to do a taster course , to decide which course I liked best . I 've gained new skills since coming to Workforce . I have more confidence and motivation to get up in the mornings . My next step is to find out what opportunities are available to me when I leave Workforce . I would like to get a job but would n't mind doing another course if it meant that I could get a better job .
