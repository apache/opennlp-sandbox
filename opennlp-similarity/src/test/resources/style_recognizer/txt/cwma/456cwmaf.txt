Supermarket Oct 2005 Project Info Artist Charlotte Thrane 's project Supermarket set out to create an environment ( installation ) based on a supermarket with the objects , activities , people , sounds and colours that can be found in such places . By creating backdrops , costumes , masks and props and thinking about poses , characters , lighting and atmosphere , pupils from Halley Primary School were encouraged to share their creative processes and make collective decisions . The project culminated in a double live still film image , projected both at the Chisenhale as part of the installation on the final day , and later at Halley Primary School .
