OMEGA 's LE902 series linear encoders work on the principle of counting pulses as a series of graduations move past a detector . These graduations are deposited on a low-temperature- coefficient glass ( quartz glass ) and counted using photodetectors . Because the glass is exceptionally stable , the pitch of the graduations does not change , resulting in inherently good long term stability . Signal conditioning is performed in an in-line electronics assembly which converts signals from the probe head to a digital format which can be plugged directly into a digital readout , computer or PLC via an RS-232 adaptor or the LDN101 network card .
