One thing you are likely to come across during the promotion of your website is link exchange programs . Essentially this is the process of obtaining a free link on a particular site by agreeing to place a link to them on your site . Be careful however not to link to ' bad neighbourhoods ' , this is what many search engines refer to as sites that attempt to exploit or degrade the relevancy of their search results . Bad neighbourhoods tend to include sites involved in link pyramids , link farms and any other activity that requires you to download pages of links to your website . Linking to bad neighbourhoods may well harm your pagerank and will not improve your position one iota . Check the pagerank of the site the listing is offered on and decide whether a link exchange would be a fair deal for both parties . If your pagerank is 0 then you wo n't have much to bargain with , alternatively if your pagerank is 6 then it will not be advantageous to pursue a link on a site with a pagerank of 0.
