The Mood Light Tile really does takes atmospheric lighting in the home or office to unprecedented levels of sophistication and versatility . The mesmeric mood light tile is similar to the classic mood light but it is specially designed to be used on its own or with one or more mood light tiles . So instead of having an aluminium frame the colour changing lens continues to the edges so that when two or more are placed together they join seamlessly . The mood light tiles also have a data link socket and a ribbon cable so that they can be linked together and work in unison . The mood light pulsates in every sequence imaginable . The Mood Light is a perfect work of art for bedrooms , living rooms , dining rooms , modern interiors , company foyers , offices , boardrooms , bars , restaurants , exhibition stands , night clubs ... it really is that special . The Mood light tile has 4 large flat light changing panels which measure 50 cm square , each of the 4 panels has integral banks of light emitting diodes that sweep and pulses in an almost infinite variety of colours .
