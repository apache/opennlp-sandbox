Shiba Inu - Guide The Shiba Inu has an alert noble look on whatever he gazes upon . This lends him an air of dignity and beauty . He is good natured , intelligent and rather curious about everything around him . He is rather independent and much like a cat will usually not come to you when called . When around strangers he is at first aloof but then usually warms up fast . Shibas are affectionate with members of their own family and people whom they trust and respect .

Shiba Inu Pictures Comments from proud Shiba Inu owners " We have had a Shiba Inu for about 6 years . We got our Sheeba when she was a puppy . She has been a great dog . She was easily house broken , and sits well , but any trick training was a waste of time , as she did n't want anything to do with it . She is very home protective ( howling and licking anyone who comes in the door ) , although when someone comes close to her fence line she barks and backs away . She has been a very good dog but would have been better without the semi-annually shedding . The girls weight about 18-21 lbs and the males weigh about 22-27 lbs . The biggest male recorded is 29 lbs . They are smaller versions of Akitas . They LOVE the weather . Sheeba loves to play in the rain and snow . She would spend all day outside if we let her . " " Our female ( Shiba Inu ) loves it when her pack is home alone . When other ' humans ' are visiting , she gets very needy and wants to be very close to us , and will actually get up on the chair with us . Of course , she just tolerates our affection and will allow us to hold her if she is in the mood . This independence is an advantage , as she can be left alone for long periods of time .
