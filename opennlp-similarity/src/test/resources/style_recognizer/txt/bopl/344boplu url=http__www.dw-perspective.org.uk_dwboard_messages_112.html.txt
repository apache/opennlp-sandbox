I saw you through Newbury on Saturday morning , thought you looked smooth and wished you well . Your time may not appear in the record books but you know what time you did , that should be all that matters . While I agree with a lot of what you have said , are you aware of the incident at Old Windsor wier that caused the race to be called off ? If not I suggest that we all wait for a public airing of the facts before we make too many judgements on what happened . From what I have heard and looking back on the information about the 1998 race when some boats did go over wiers I think DW had no option ( with the EA pressure ) but to call the race off once an incident had happened . I am not part of the DW organisation but as I understand it the race was not called of until 6am - after you had got on the water and started . Perhaps there should have been better co-ordination to advise you of the situation before you started but these things do happen . Let us hope that there is a speedy public discussion of what did happen and that new rules can be created to cope with this situation in the future if that is what it requires . * * * Follow-Ups : * * * [ Devizes to Westminster Discussion Area ] [ FAQ ] Post Follow-Up : Name : E-Mail : Subject : Message : : Duncan : : First congratulations on a new ( unofficial ) record .
