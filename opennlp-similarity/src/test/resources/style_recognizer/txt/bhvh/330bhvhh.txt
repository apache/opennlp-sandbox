Weight and Body Mass Index A more realistic statistic of how your own body weight compares with general population norms , is an estimate of Body Mass Index ( or BMI ) . This takes into consideration your weight and height ( but not your build ) . You could try the following calculation : Take your weight in Pounds and multiply this by 700 Then divide by your height in Inches Again , divide by your height in Inches The sum is a number representing your BMI If your BMI falls below 20 , than this suggests that you are underweight . If your BMI falls above 27 then this suggests that you are overweight . If your BMI falls below 18 or above 30 then you should speak to your GP about this . For example for a person who weighs 9 stone 7 lbs . ( 133 lbs . ) , and who is 5 feet 5 inches ( 65 inches ) tall 133lbs multiplied by 700 = 93100 Divided by 65 inches = 1432 Divided by 65 inches = a body mass index of 22 ( which falls within the healthy range ) Remember that this calculation gives you only a rough guide to weight in comparison with your height and that there are many other factors which contribute towards maintaining a healthy body weight . If you are concerned about your weight why do n't you make an appointment to see your GP , or visit the Health Centre to see the Practice Nurse or to attend A Well Woman / A Well Man Clinic . You could also visit a counsellor at the Counselling Service to discuss some of your concerns . This page is maintained by the Student Support and Counselling Service
