Overcoming hurdles in negotiation the Australian way 28 Jun 2004 On 2 June 2004 over 30 delegates attended a whole-day workshop at CEDR run by Professor John Wade . Lecturing at Bond University in Queensland , John is a leader in three fields in Australia : mediator , academic focussing on ADR , and law-lecturer . The workshop concentrated on overcoming common hurdles in negotiation . By not focussing solely on mediation , he stimulated an audience drawn mostly from the business sector with techniques for progressing and unblocking negotiations . Feedback from delegates was universally complimentary . Some particularly liked John 's checklists and crib cards . Others enjoyed insights into the psychology of negotiation . John writes regularly in the Bond University Dispute Resolution News e-mail newsletter which can be found at www . b ond . e du . a u/law/centres/drc/newsletter For information about other seminars or workshops aimed at the business sector , please contact Terry Jones at CEDR ( tjones@cedr . c o. u k ) who is always pleased to talk about cutting the cost of conflict and the use of mediation and related techniques in the business sector .
