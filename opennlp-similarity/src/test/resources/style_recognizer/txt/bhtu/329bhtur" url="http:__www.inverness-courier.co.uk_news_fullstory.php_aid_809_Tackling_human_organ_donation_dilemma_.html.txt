Tackling human organ donation dilemma By Andy Dixon Published : 29 August , 2006 IT is not easy to talk about your death or the death of those you love . However , by discussing organ donation it could potentially save someone 's life . Thousands of Scots are on the waiting list and hundreds die whilst waiting for a crucial organ transplant . The public in Inverness have the chance to save lives when the Scottish Executive 's organ donation road show kicks-off at Eastgate shopping centre tomorrow . It is part of a nationwide campaign to encourage more people to sign-up to the Organ Donor Register ( ODR ) . There are over 13.5 million people on the register , a confidential , computerised database used to help establish those who want to donate organs . Shoppers will be given the chance to sign-up on the spot with Scottish Executive representatives on hand to explain the importance of organ donations . The road show coincides with the launch of new legislation coming into effect on Friday . Under the Human Tissue ( Scotland ) Act 2006 , the wishes of people who choose to be considered as organ donors in the event of their death will be respected . Donald Cadzow ( 69 ) is a haemo-dialysis patient at Raigmore Hospital on the transplant waiting list for almost three years . Mr Cadzow , who suffers from total renal failure , attends the hospital three days a week and does not have any dialysis at home . " It 's a condition that does n't get better so I accept it , " he said . " I have had to build my life around it . " The retired Caithness farmer , who now lives just outside of Tain , returned from a three week holiday in Australia last week . He said the hospital arranged for him to continue having his treatment abroad , but does not know how long he will be waiting for a transplant . " There are various tests to see if a kidney is suitable , so I have to wait for the right one to come along , but there 's no time limit , " he added . Jane Bryce ( 60 ) , of Nairn , had a kidney transplant 10 years ago and said her life has been vastly improved thanks to the donation . She was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease , a hereditary condition that her father also suffered from . " I was born with a cyst in my kidney , " said Mrs Bryce , treasurer of the Highlands and Islands Kidney Patients Association for the last five years . " For patients like me the cysts grow and sometimes it will never affect a person , but for others it can block kidney functions and that 's what happened to me . " Mrs Bryce has been involved with the association for around 11 years , working within Raigmore Hospital and around the city with the Scottish Kidney Federation to offer support for people who have had kidney failure . " When you 're first diagnosed there is a very odd feeling , " explained Mrs Bryce . " You know that you 're living with a disease that you know would get you , but you are not sure when . " I was very lucky though , because I was only on the waiting list for three years which is a relatively short time . " Whilst she was waiting , Mrs Bryce had to do 30 minutes of home dialysis four times a day . " I would get very tired , " she said . " You have to watch every drop you drink and be careful about what you eat because it can be very toxic . " It can be hard because you also have to restrict your activities . " She still has to take medication to maintain the transplant but says the ODR and the introduction of new legislation is a good idea and will hopefully change some attitudes . " When the family are in a position with the death of a loved one it is a very difficult time , so it is perhaps better to discuss the topic beforehand , " she said .

" The kidney transplant I had has changed my life dramatically and improved it immeasurably , but with heart , liver and lung transplants it saves their lives . " Debbie Gallacher , transplant co-ordinator at NHS Highlands , said the new legislation is very important for encouraging more donations . Until this Friday it is still down to the next of kin of individuals who carry a donor card or are on the donor register as to whether their organs can be used after their deaths . New laws will mean relatives will no longer be asked for their consent . But if families do object then it would be unlikely to go ahead . The problem in the past is families have objected to allowing their loved one 's organs to be used . Mrs Gallacher said until last month , NHS Highland 's waiting lists on transplants stood at approximately 120 for kidney patients and 20 for heart , lung and liver replacements . But last year the Highland 's had the highest increase in willing donors in Scotland . Dr Stewart Lambie , renal consultant at Raigmore Hospital for just over a year , said transplants offer a two-fold improvement in people 's lives . " They no longer have the burden of dialysis and it allows them to live longer , " said Dr Lambie He stressed the importance of the ODR and said it takes the pressure off families as they can be seen to do the wishes of their loved one . One school of thought backs an opt-out , rather than opt-in system , whereby people are automatically considered for donation unless they specify that they do not want their organs to be used for transplants , but this can be controversial . " I think the ODR and new legislation is a fairly good compromise because there are moral and ethical issues to be considered , " added Dr Lambie . " There may be a change in the future , but there would be a lot of debate , however the new legislation needs a bedding-in period and then an assessment of its impact . " Live donations is another area encouraged which allows people to donate a kidney to save someone 's life . " As the list of patients waiting for a transplant is steadily rising , we are trying to increase the number of live donors , " added Dr Lambie . " The number at this hospital at the moment is moving towards somewhere between 30 per cent and 50 per cent and I would like to see that go up a bit more . " Research commissioned by UK Transplant , part of the NHS , shows nine out of 10 people are in favour of organ donation in principle across Scotland , however only 27 per cent of the nation has joined the ODR . The statistics for the UK show that since 1st April , 305 people have donated organs , 918 people have received transplants and 6970 people are still on the waiting list , with 729 living in Scotland . " Transplants save and enhance thousands of lives every year , but there is a desperate shortage of donated organs , " said Chris Rudge , UK Transplant managing director . " Right now more than 6000 people in the UK are waiting for an organ transplant but the shortage means that fewer than 3000 can be carried out each year . " Almost 500 people die every year while waiting , " he continued .
