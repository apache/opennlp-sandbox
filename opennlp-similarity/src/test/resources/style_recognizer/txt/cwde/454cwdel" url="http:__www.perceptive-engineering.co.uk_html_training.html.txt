Perceptive Engineering offer three day training courses throughout the year . The objectives of these courses are to provide an introduction to the techniques that are available within the monitorMVÂ™ software package , to demonstrate how this package can be applied to industrial plants in real-time and to highlight the benefits that monitorMV can offer operations and engineering staff . Throughout the course mathematical technicalities are kept to a minimum with greater emphasis being placed on the practical issues of the statistical technology and control within monitorMV . At the end of the course , attendees should be in a position where they are comfortable with the monitorMV software environment , able to analyse process data and capable of developing effective real-time condition monitoring solutions for application to industrial process plant . Structure of the Course The 3-day training course divides itself naturally into three key issues : An overview of multivariate statistical techniques and their exploitation in the monitorMV software package . This issue is addressed in the first half of day one of the course . A detailed exploration of the off-line analysis capabilities of monitorMV is provided which together with a series of hands-on case studies provides the attendee with a thorough understanding of both the capabilities and configuration of the monitorMV package when applied to both continuous and batch operations . Overview of the on-line capabilities of monitorMV and its integration within a complete solution . Please download our training course flyer .
