Celebration Churches Network in Bristol Individual churches who network together under the ' CELEBRATION Churches ' banner come from a variety of backgrounds and denominations . We aim to function as a ' fellowship of fellowships ' , committed to outworking a common vision & seeking a region wide expression of church in Bristol & the surrounding area . Our relationship is based on mutual respect , a desire to express Christian unity & a recognition that if the one million people of the Bristol region are to be reached with the good news of Jesus , partnership rather than competition between churches is vital . Ebe is one of the ' Celebration Churches ' in Bristol . Vision of Celebration Churches EXPRESSING UNITY . We aim to pray & share ministry together because we recognise that unity brings pleasure to God & provides the context in which He has promised blessing . REACHING COMMUNITIES . we aim to strengthen & resource existing local churches & newly planted churches in order that every home & family in Bristol region will be reached with the good news of Jesus . TOUCHING LOCAL SOCIETY . we aim , through prayer , witness & social action , to influence every area of life in the region , with a particular desire to express care for the most marginalised & vulnerable .
