ALEX BRUMMER , DAILY MAIL CITY EDITOR Ratcatcher poisons pensions Alex Brummer , Daily Mail 21 December 2005 THE attempt by Rentokil to abrogate its contract with employees inside its defined salary pension scheme should be fiercely opposed . If the workers concerned are well enough organised then they could almost certainly mount a legal challenge . They could also follow the example of workers in the public sector and at Centrica , and threaten to bring the company to a halt by withdrawing their labour . The attempt to end accruals to defined benefit pension plans could ride roughshod over contract law and the rights of trustees . Senior business figures also believe that the employees concerned may well have a challenge to make under employment law , arguing that the change in pension arrangements is such an important part of their compensation package that it amounts to constructive dismissal . Efforts by second-line firms like Iceland to abolish defined benefit pensions for the existing workforce met with stiff resistance . When chairman Brian McGowan of Rentokil was seeking to fend off the unwanted attentions of Sir Gerry Robinson neither he nor his executives mentioned plans to poison the future retirement of its workforce . Paradoxically , employees might have been better protected had Robinson succeeded , since a change of control would have required approval by the Pensions Regulator . Each successive move by Labour to reform pensions has served to undermine private schemes . In addition to the 1997 tax raid , the government has added to the cost of pensions by imposing new reporting requirements and most recently through the Pensions Protection Fund . Moreover , the Turner report , by floating the idea of automatic enrolment for workers and lower compulsory contributions for employers , in many ways encourages companies to think about a future in which they can cut their pension costs . The private pensions crisis becomes more serious by the day . Whereas it is possible for the Royal Mail to solve its pension shortfall by loading up the price of a first class stamp to 39p , most companies operating in competitive markets do not have that option . Broker Citigroup has downgraded the shares of ICI ( in which I hold shares ) because of an estimated rise in its pensions deficit of £ 200m to £ 350m . If it sought to raise the price of paint or perfume ingredients to cover the cost it would be slaughtered . The Rentokil decision should not be seen as a signal to FTSE 100 companies that they should follow the same route . All parties need to play a greater part in saving private pensions . Companies and employees need to increase contributions . The government needs to rethink the new rules imposed and offer much more generous tax incentives to Footsie firms willing to resolve their own pension deficits , rather than shuffle the responsibility off to the state . Card retreat LLOYDS TSB having stonewalled our inquiries about the impending sale of Goldfish to Morgan Stanley , has now announced the deal to the market . No doubt the £ 1bn raised will be useful at a time when the bank has had to raise provisions for endowment mis-selling by its Scottish Widows arm . The Goldfish sale does not make a great deal of sense for a leading retail bank . The economics of credit cards are all about scale and if the 800,000 Goldfish customers are useful to Morgan Stanley they would have been just as helpful to Lloyds which already has 5m credit card customers . It is always very nice to make a turn and Lloyds TSB has come out of Goldfish with a modest profit estimated at £ 70m having originally bought the brand from Centrica . But the return can hardly be considered stellar . Indeed , it could have made as much by simply deploying the capital in the money markets . Terri Dial 's first major decision as head of retail banking is to retreat from a business which rivals like HSBC - which bought the M&S credit card book - still believe has a future . Lloyds TSB has more explaining to do . HBOS hit HBOS , the Halifax Bank of Scotland group , prides itself on the brilliance of its corporate banking teams . It was among the main financial backers of Philip Green in his conquest of the High Street and was ready to back the Arcadia boss in taking over Marks & Spencer in 2004 . Now , however , Bank of Scotland will take an estimated £ 5m hit from the closure of 160-year-old off-licence chain Unwins , where the family was bought out earlier this year . It could also suffer as a result of the accounting mess at music group Sanctuary . Not every entrepreneur is a Philip Green .
