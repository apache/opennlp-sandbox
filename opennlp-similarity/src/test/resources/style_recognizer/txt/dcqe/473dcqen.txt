I have always been fascinated by the 21st century . I wish I had lived then - in the Golden Age , before London drowned . Before robots thought they could think . I have an old map of the London Tube from that distant past . Those words of Dr Webber - ' Jubilee , Bakerloo and Circle ' . They are old Tube lines . They all go through Baker Street . That tunnel where Webber 's prisoners were trapped had pictures of Sherlock Holmes on the tiles . Holmes lived in Baker Street . Also , when we tried to swim into Baker Street station , the platforms had been blocked by strange metal walls . We searched the area until we found a tiny , hidden tunnel in the basement of the Planetarium . We climbed into it . It led us deep underground , until we came , at last , to Baker Street Station . I saw the ancient tiles with their pictures of Sherlock Holmes . And I saw forty or fifty people sat still and lifeless , wearing magnet-hats . Three robot guards appeared . Using robot picture language , I asked them how to put the personalities back into the victims ' brains . They showed me . There was a slot inside each magnet-hat where the crystal fitted . I did n't know which crystal came from which person . We had no time to find out . Dr Webber would be here soon . We quickly placed all the crystals into the magnet-hats and turned the power on . Seconds later , the lifeless people began to move .
