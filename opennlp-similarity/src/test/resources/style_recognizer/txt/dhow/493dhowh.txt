Mark Gavillet , ' no conferring ' , 1999 . Steel , fabric , foam , office chairs . A beginner 's guide to shameless self-promotion 1. Start exhibiting as soon as possible , preferably before you leave college . The key to getting work shown is to have a history of having shown work . The more diverse your CV , the more appealing it is . Aim above your expectations . There is always compromise involved - make sure it is on your side . Do not however expect to be paid . 2. Consider exhibiting abroad . Use the novelty of being a foreign artist to your advantage . A list of international exhibitions on your CV gives the impression that your career is at a more advanced stage than it actually is . 3. Do your homework and find out who can help you . Go to as many openings as possible until you meet that person . You are in a much better position when talking to someone who has enjoyed too much complimentary wine than you are when you phone their office . Discreetly work into the conversation who you are , what you do , and arrange to meet them at a later date . The art world can be a very incestuous place to be . Jump on the bandwagon .
