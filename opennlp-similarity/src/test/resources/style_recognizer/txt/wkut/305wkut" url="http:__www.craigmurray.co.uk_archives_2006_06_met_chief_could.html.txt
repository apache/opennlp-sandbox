The Observer can reveal that the Metropolitan Police commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , and two senior commanders in control of the operation that culminated in de Menezes 's death are the focus of the final legal analysis of the shooting by Crown prosecutors . If the CPS goes ahead with the dramatic move , the decision would pile further pressure on the already beleaguered head of Scotland Yard . Legal sources close to the CPS case have revealed that , following a four-month review of a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission , prosecutors are considering whether the command team are ultimately responsible , a decision that could give rise to a charge of gross negligence manslaughter against Blair and two other senior figures .

I 'll bet there are a few worried ( desperate ? ) senior cops and spooks right now . If they ca n't get any ' evidence ' together shortly it 's going to be ever so embarrassing . And note the constantly changing unattributable stories about the circumstances of both the shooting and the type of ' bomb ' . Yes indeed , news management at its finest .
