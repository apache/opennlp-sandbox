Due to expansive growth over the past few years , IAE has invested significantly in new technologies to improve manufacturing processes and decrease lead times to our customers . A large part of this investment has been within our Planning and Design department , who have been traditionally designing using standard 2D CAD technology . We have recently implemented a 3D CAD product called SolidWorks . IAE selected SolidWorks mechanical design software because of its ease of use , large assembly performance , design tables , configurations , powerful modelling tools and automated BOM generation capabilities . By deploying SolidWorks , IAE Limited has reduced its design cycles , streamlined development , and improved product visualization and communication to our customers . Using SolidWorks has allowed us to meet our customers ' demands quickly and easily .
