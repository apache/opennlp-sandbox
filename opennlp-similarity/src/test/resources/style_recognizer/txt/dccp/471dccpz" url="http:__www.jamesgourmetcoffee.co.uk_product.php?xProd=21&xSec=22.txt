Brazilian Daterrra Special Reserve Ultimate Single Origin Espresso . This coffee is so limited ... when it 's gone , we have to wait till next season . V acuum of supply since it was the winning coffee at the World Barista Championships . The espresso is grassy , fresh and chocolaty smooth . To my suprise , it even works well with milk , which is really unexpected ... Louis Norbeeto Pascoal , the director of Daterra . He has an infectious passion , which is backed by an incredible knowledge and understanding of chemistry and coffee farming .
