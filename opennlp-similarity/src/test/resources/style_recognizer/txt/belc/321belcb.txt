well I have n't seen much of animatrix ... thought it looked good as i like all things manga ! I really enjoyed Matrix 1 s ... just thought that Matrix 2 made the mistake of bieng so very unfinnished ... I mean take Star wars ... EMPIRE is a class film in its own right ... does n't really leave you hanging on ! ! Just thought the matrix2 was all too much seeming to happen in one day . Aw well it would n't do if we all like d the same things _________________ ------------------------------------------------- The Black Presence in Britain - Black British History .
