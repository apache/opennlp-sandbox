﻿ Amos 1 1 The words of Amos , one of the shepherds of Tekoa—what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake , when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash[a ] was king of Israel . 2 He said : “ The LORD roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem ; the pastures of the shepherds dry up , [ b ] and the top of Carmel withers . ” Judgment on Israel’s Neighbors 3 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Damascus , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth , 4 I will send fire upon the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad . 5 I will break down the gate of Damascus ; I will destroy the king who is in[c ] the Valley of Aven[d ] and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden . The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir , ” says the LORD . 6 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Gaza , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom , 7 I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses . 8 I will destroy the king[e ] of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon . I will turn my hand against Ekron , till the last of the Philistines is dead , ” says the Sovereign LORD . 9 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Tyre , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom , disregarding a treaty of brotherhood , 10 I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses . ” 11 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Edom , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because he pursued his brother with a sword , stifling all compassion , [ f ] because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked , 12 I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah . ” 13 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Ammon , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders , 14 I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle , amid violent winds on a stormy day . 15 Her king[g ] will go into exile , he and his officials together , ” says the LORD . ** Amos 2 1 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Moab , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because he burned , as if to lime , the bones of Edom’s king , 2 I will send fire upon Moab that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth . [ a ] Moab will go down in great tumult amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet . 3 I will destroy her ruler and kill all her officials with him , ” says the LORD . 4 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Judah , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . Because they have rejected the law of the LORD and have not kept his decrees , because they have been led astray by false gods , [ b ] the gods[c ] their ancestors followed , 5 I will send fire upon Judah that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem . ” Judgment on Israel 6 This is what the LORD says : “ For three sins of Israel , even for four , I will not turn back my wrath . They sell the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of sandals . 7 They trample on the heads of the poor as upon the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed . Father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name . 8 They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge . In the house of their god they drink wine taken as fines . 9 “ I destroyed the Amorite before them , though he was tall as the cedars and strong as the oaks . I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below . 10 “ I brought you up out of Egypt , and I led you forty years in the desert to give you the land of the Amorites . 11 I also raised up prophets from among your sons and Nazirites from among your young men . Is this not true , people of Israel ? ” declares the LORD . 12 “ But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy . 13 “ Now then , I will crush you as a cart crushes when loaded with grain . 14 The swift will not escape , the strong will not muster their strength , and the warrior will not save his life . 15 The archer will not stand his ground , the fleet-footed soldier will not get away , and the horseman will not save his life . 16 Even the bravest warriors will flee naked on that day , ” declares the LORD .
