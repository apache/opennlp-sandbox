The Pensions Regulator " The Pensions Bill sets out proposals for a new pensions regulator to give better protection to members of work-based pension schemes and to reduce the compliance burden on well-run schemes . " It will focus on protecting the benefits of pension scheme members , concentrating its effort on schemes where it assesses that there is a high risk of fraud , bad governance or poor administration . The Pensions Regulator will have important new powers to tackle under-funding . " The Regulator will not overburden employers who provide pension schemes , enabling well-administered and funded schemes the freedom to continue supporting their schemes without being subject to constant , intrusive and burdensome regulation .
