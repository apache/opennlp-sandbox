Date : April 2006 Implementation date : April 2006 Review Date : October 2008 GUIDELINES FOR SUPERVISORS OF MIDWIVES IN THE EAST MIDLANDS MATERNAL DEATHS BACKGROUND The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health ( previously CEMD ) is a triennial report , which provides on overview of the numbers and causes of maternal death in the United Kingdom . The collated and anonymised information shows where improvements in clinical practice or service provision may help to prevent future deaths . It is therefore important that all cases are notified promptly so that full information on each case is readily available . CEMD and the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Infant Deaths ( CESDI ) merged to form the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health ( CEMACH ) on the 1 st April 2003. These enquiries form part of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) work programme . It is statutory requirement that all health professionals provide information and participate in confidential enquiries and supervisors of midwives should ensure that other areas of the health service , such as Accident and Emergency units and Intensive Care are aware of this requirement and have a local process in place to report maternal deaths to the supervisor of midwives . The aims and objectives of the CEMACH Enquiry are to ; · Assess the main causes of and trends in maternal deaths , to identify any avoidable or substandard factors and to share these findings with all relevant health care professionals . · Improve the care that women receive and to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates . · To make recommendations on clinical care and service provision , including audit . · To suggest areas for future research and audit at a local and national level . · Produce a triennial report on behalf of CEMACH . DEFINITION OF A MATERNAL DEATH A Maternal Death is defined as any death , which occurs during or within one year of pregnancy , childbirth or abortion . This may be directly , indirectly or unrelated to the pregnancy . Direct - a death resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state ( pregnancy , labour and puerperuim ) , from interventions , omissions , incorrect treatment , or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above . Indirect - a death resulting from previous existing disease , or disease that developed during pregnancy and which was not due to direct obstetric cause , but which was aggravated by the physiological affects of pregnancy . Coincidental - a death that occurs from unrelated causes , which happens to occur in the pregnancy or puerperuim e. g . road traffic accident . Late - a death occurring between 42 days and one year after termination of pregnancy , miscarriage or delivery that are due to direct or indirect maternal causes . Pregnancy related deaths - a death occurring in women while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy , irrespective of cause of death . All Maternal Deaths should be notified to the LSA Midwifery Officer on the following working day , using the specific proforma that accompanies this document . IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - DIRECT MATERNAL DEATH IN HOSPITAL The on call Supervisor of Midwives ( SoM(s ) ) and Consultant on call should be contacted and asked to attend . The following procedures outline the key responsibilities of the SoM . · The Consultant on call should be asked to attend . They should meet relatives as soon as possible . The women 's named Consultant should be informed when he/she is next on duty . · Support and information must be given to the immediate relatives/next of kin . Relatives may wish for religious or spiritual support . The Hospital chaplain may be contacted if appropriate . · Ensure that the Coroner has been notified . The Coroner 's office should be contacted ( cross reference your Local Policy for contact numbers ) . Out of hours a Coroner 's officer is available for emergencies ( 24 hour service ) . · The attending doctor cannot issue a death certificate without first referring for consideration by HM Coroner ( The mortuary department should be informed that a maternal death has occurred and to expect the patient without a death certificate ) . · Ensure appropriate provision is made for the baby ; consider social services for help and advice particularly if the couple are not married . · The senior clinician present should inform the family that it is not possible to issue a death certificate without consideration of post-mortem by the Coroner . · The Serious Untoward Incident Policy should be initiated and details of the incident made available ( if appropriate a Root Cause Analysis ( RCA ) will be undertaken by the Risk Management Team , a SoM must be involved in the RCA ( cross reference Reporting and Monitoring of Serious Adverse Events , Investigation of Incidents and the Role of the LSA ) ) . · The medical records should be reviewed and the SoM involved should complete a summary of the case . It is important to note the names of all staff involved , particularly those staff that do not normally work with the Maternity Unit ( i. e . Operation Department Assistant ( ODA ) or Operation Department Practitioner ( ODP ) , crash teams , attending anaesthetists etc . ) . · The case notes and all documentation should be completed , photocopied and secured at the first opportunity . There should be an early review of the records ; the midwifery care given should be reviewed by the SoM . · The SoM will ensure that appropriate support is offered to the staff involved . Personnel such as the staff counsellor or Hospital chaplain may support the SoM with this . · The SoM responsible for CEMACH and the Head of Midwifery ( HoM ) should be informed as soon as possible within normal working hours . Appendix 1 offers a checklist that may be used . IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - DIRECT MATERNAL DEATH IN PRIMARY CARE The woman 's Midwife is responsible for ensuring that a SoM is informed of any maternal death that comes to her attention in the Primary Care setting . The SoM will notify the HoM and the LSA and CEMACH . The GP should also have notified the Hospital if the woman has delivered or received care there . ROLE OF THE CEMACH SUPERVISOR OF MIDWIVES · The CEMACH SoM may need to be released from duties to undertake this role . · The CEMACH SoM should ensure that the local Trusts policies have been followed . · The death is reported as a Serious Untoward Incident ( SUI ) . This is usually undertaken via the Trusts Governance leads . · The death will be reported the Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officer ( LSAMO ) as soon as practicably possible initially verbally followed by the maternal death proforma . · The SoM should ensure communication takes place within and across the primary and secondary sector , including the family GP , and any other statutory agency connected to the family . · The CEMACH SoM will arrange a debriefing of all staff involved . OTHER DEATHS ( INDIRECT , CONICIDENTAL AND LATE ) All other deaths should be dealt with on an individual basis as these may include , murder , suicide , road traffic collision , women with known terminal illness . COMPLETING THE ENQUIRY FORM The CEMACH SoM coordinating the enquiry should send a copy of the CEMACH notification form to the regional coordinator .
