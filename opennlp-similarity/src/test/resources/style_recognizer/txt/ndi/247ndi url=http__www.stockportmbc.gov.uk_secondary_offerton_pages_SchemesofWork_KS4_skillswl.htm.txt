Skills for Working Life What is the course about ? These courses are all Work Related and are more hands on than the GCSE courses at school . The idea is to prepare students for the world of work and to give them a platform to further work related courses or training at 16 . The courses require students to attend North Area College for one full day a week and there is a requirement to catch up on any school work missed during that day . Good attendance , punctuality , motivation and the ability to work independently are all important for success these courses . What will students be studying ? The following courses are available for study : - Hairdressing - Beauty - Sport and Recreation - Health and Social care All these courses follow Skills for Working Life qualification in year 10 . In year 11 most students move onto an NVQ Level 1 ( National Vocational Qualification ) or a VRQ ( Vocational Related Qualification ) or equivalent . How will I be assessed ? Students are assessed by their tutor at college at regular intervals . Although most of the assessments are practical , there are some written tests . E. g . Health and Safety . Students build up a portfolio of work as they progress through the course . A teacher from school will come to college every week to help students and to look at their work .
