No , it is not what you think . The Strathclyde Police Training College , based in Jackton near East Kilbride , has just agreed to a work based learning programme in training and learning for its staff of police trainers . This will be entirely designed and delivered by the SCWBL . The college recruits police officers who are at the leading edge of their specialism to train other police officers - in ICT , for example . These trainers stay on average three years in the college before returning to normal duties . So there is constant movement of officers ( or students as we would now like to call them ) . The intention is to make the work based learning programme compulsory guaranteeing a healthy supply of students . The officers have a qualification up to level two , so by undertaking six modules at level three with Glasgow Caledonian University over their stay at Jackton , they will be able to graduate with a general degree . The curriculum will cover : Personal and Professional Development ; Teaching and Learning ; Leadership , Motivation and Group Dynamics ; Curriculum Development including Training Needs Analysis ; Quality and Evaluation and Organisational Culture and Change . Supporting materials will be available in paper based format for use during workshops . However , for those unable to attend workshops , or perhaps as well as for use during workshops , materials will also be available on the University 's online managed learning environment system - Blackboard . The online materials will also include additional materials such as websites , further reading , student activities and formative assessments . One important aspect of the course from the Police Force 's point of view is that Diversity - equal opportunities awareness - will run through all the materials and all the assessments . John Queen who has been working with the Strathclyde Police for some time on the TLTM programme and Alison Nimmo who provided exemplar materials for the discussions with the police force are delighted with the decision of the police . They are looking forward to supporting the first cohort of students/officers when they begin the course in April this year .
