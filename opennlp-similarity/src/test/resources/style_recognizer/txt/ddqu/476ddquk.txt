Child not enrolled at a state school If you decide to home educate in Scotland and your child is not enrolled as a pupil at a ' public ' ( i. e . state ) school , there is no legal obligation to register with , or otherwise inform , your local authority , although you might reasonably expect its officers to request information about your arrangements if you come to their attention .
